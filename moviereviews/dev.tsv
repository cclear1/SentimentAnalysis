7886	This big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow .	2
7887	The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .	2
7888	The comedy is nonexistent .	0

7932	Succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture .	3
7933	It may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ?	2
7934	A backstage must-see for true fans of comedy .	4
7935	Allen 's funniest and most likeable movie in years .	4

7970	the film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half	1
7971	It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho-Tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .	1
7972	If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .	2

7985	This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .	1
7986	Director Charles Stone III applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about Drumline is its energy .	4

8012	Wanker Goths are on the loose !	2
8013	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .	1

8027	In questioning the election process , Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box .	3
8028	While the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .	1
8029	It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .	3
8030	The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth Bullock and the nonchalant Grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment .	4
8031	Norton holds the film together .	2

8040	Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .	0
8041	Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .	0
8042	I am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from TV shows , but Hey Arnold !	3

8052	By and large this is Mr. Kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since The Doors .	3
8053	This masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short .	3
8054	The charming result is Festival in Cannes .	3
8055	`` Home Movie '' is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book .	2
8056	Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '	1
8057	Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .	2
8058	So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .	2
8059	The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers .	2
8060	Me Without You has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood .	4
8061	Some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since `` Saving Private Ryan '' have been recreated by John Woo in this little-known story of Native Americans and their role in the second great war .	3
8062	... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !	0
8063	The story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired .	1
8064	There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .	1
8065	On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .	1
8066	Shiner can certainly go the distance , but is n't world championship material	3
8067	The film is bright and flashy in all the right ways .	4
8068	If anything , see it for Karen Black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick .	3
8069	The AAA of action , XXX is a blast of adrenalin , rated EEE for excitement .	4
8070	What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .	0
8071	A well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .	4
8072	An old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts .	3

8074	Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .	0
8075	Brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as Bond in Die Another Day .	4
8076	Goes a long way on hedonistic gusto .	2
8077	Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a Mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .	3
8078	I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .	1
8079	The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .	1
8080	The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .	1
8081	Steven Soderbergh 's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life .	3
8082	Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .	0
8083	Sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .	1
8084	No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .	0
8085	What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .	1
8086	Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .	1
8087	When compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , Davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic .	4
8088	The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .	3
8089	Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .	3
8090	Heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple 's moral ascension .	2
8091	Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .	0

8093	A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .	4
8094	Fred Schepisi 's tale of four Englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point .	3

8096	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .	0
8097	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .	1
8098	The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .	1
8099	One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .	1
8100	A captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller .	3
8101	The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .	1
8102	I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .	3
8103	Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .	0
8104	Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .	1
8105	The script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .	1
8106	The art demands live viewing .	3
8107	Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .	1
8108	None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .	0
8109	This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .	1
8110	Visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying .	2
8111	But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .	3
8112	Vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores .	3
8113	It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .	0
8114	The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul 's perspective .	3
8115	A moving and weighty depiction of one family 's attempts to heal after the death of a child .	3
8116	As I settled into my World War II memories , I found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances .	3
8117	This is amusing for about three minutes .	2
8118	Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .	2
8119	As happily glib and vicious as its characters .	2
8120	Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances .	4
8121	It really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` Evelyn . '	3
8122	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .	1
8123	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .	1
8124	The picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance .	3
8125	An elegant and sly deadpan comedy .	3
8126	With its hint of an awkward Hitchcockian theme in tact , Harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone	2
8127	The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .	0
8128	Best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events .	3
8129	Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .	0
8130	Debate it .	2
8131	A wildly entertaining scan of Evans ' career .	4
8132	Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .	4
8133	But not without cheesy fun factor .	3
8134	Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .	3
8135	A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .	3
8136	A dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3D goggles the theater provides .	3
8137	Could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals .	3
8138	Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .	1
8139	I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .	0
8140	Gambling and throwing a basketball game for money is n't a new plot -- in fact Toback himself used it in Black and White .	2
8141	With an admirably dark first script by Brent Hanley , Paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work .	4
8142	Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness .	4
8143	Douglas McGrath 's Nicholas Nickleby does Dickens as it should be done cinematically .	4
8144	How I Killed My Father would be a rarity in Hollywood .	2
8145	The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .	2
8146	That the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that Chin 's film serves up with style and empathy .	3
8147	Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would .	1
8148	The film 's only missteps come from the script 's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of Abagnale 's antics .	2
8149	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .	1
8150	A thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions .	4
8151	Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .	1
8152	Even through its flaws , Revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film .	3
8153	It 's still Adam Sandler , and it 's not Little Nicky .	2
8154	Sorvino is delightful in the central role .	3
8155	Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .	2
8156	An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .	0
8157	Exhilarating but blatantly biased .	3
8158	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .	0
8159	Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .	1
8160	First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .	3
8161	It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .	0
8162	What makes it worth watching is Quaid 's performance .	3
8163	By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .	3
8164	An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .	2
8165	Especially give credit to Affleck .	4
8166	If you grew up on Scooby -- you 'll love this movie .	3
8167	It 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon , Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter , yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb .	4
8168	After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .	0
8169	The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .	1
8170	Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .	1
8171	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .	1
8172	There 's no good answer to that one .	1
8173	Singer\/composer Bryan Adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .	3
8174	It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .	0
8175	Seriously , rent the Disney version .	1
8176	You 'll forget about it by Monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids .	0
8177	Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .	0
8178	No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .	0
8179	A remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .	3
8180	If you 're a fan of the series you 'll love it and probably want to see it twice .	4
8181	Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .	1
8182	It does n't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain .	1
8183	If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .	1
8184	... a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance	2
8185	If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .	2
8186	Like a can of 2-day old Coke .	0
8187	What Jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery	1
8188	As a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , Kissing Jessica Steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious .	4
8189	Humorous and heartfelt , Douglas McGrath 's version of ` Nicholas Nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful .	4
8190	... a solid , well-formed satire .	4
8191	May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .	1
8192	The Lady and the Duke is Eric Rohmer 's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama	2
8193	Assayas ' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of Jacques Chardonne 's novel .	3
8194	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .	0
8195	There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .	2
8196	A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .	1
8197	It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .	0
8198	I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .	2
8199	The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .	0
8200	About as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come .	4
8201	Thumbs up to Paxton for not falling into the Hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer .	4
8202	Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .	1
8203	Together -LRB- Time Out and Human Resources -RRB- establish Mr. Cantet as France 's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace .	3
8204	It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity .	3
8205	The chocolate factory without Charlie .	1
8206	Why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the TV cow is free ?	1
8207	The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .	1
8208	We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .	0
8209	Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .	0
8210	But the actors make this worth a peek .	3
8211	This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .	0
8212	A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .	1
8213	The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .	0
8214	Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-Semitism ever seen on screen .	4
8215	Conceptually brilliant ... Plays like a living-room War Of The Worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown .	3
8216	I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat .	0
8217	Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .	2
8218	It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .	3
8219	This is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope .	4
8220	-LRB- Ferrera -RRB- has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .	4
8221	We get an image of Big Papa spanning history , rather than suspending it .	2
8222	`` On Guard ! ''	2
8223	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .	1
8224	An eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake .	4
8225	Fortunately , Elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry .	3
8226	Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham .	4
8227	Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .	1
8228	- I also wanted a little alien as a friend !	3
8229	It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do .	4
8230	Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?	1
8231	Though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .	1
8232	Not everyone will welcome or accept The Trials of Henry Kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one .	3
8233	It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .	0
8234	A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .	0
8235	Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .	0
8236	The Mothman Prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey .	3
8237	An oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion .	3
8238	Although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .	2
8239	Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .	0
8240	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .	0
8241	-LRB- Allen -RRB- manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise .	3
8242	After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .	1
8243	There are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we 're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why .	3
8244	Who cares ? -RRB- .	1
8245	While general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of Cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds .	4
8246	Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .	1
8247	A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters .	3
8248	A typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate French coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it .	2
8249	Good , solid storytelling .	4
8250	As gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .	4
8251	We 're drawn in by the dark luster .	3
8252	A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .	2
8253	A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached .	4
8254	Congrats Disney on a job well done , I enjoyed it just as much !	4
8255	Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .	2
8256	Big time .	2
8257	I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .	1
8258	It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .	1
8259	... would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie 's edges .	2
8260	Cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .	2
8261	A rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and Japanese animation .	3
8262	Oozes condescension from every pore .	2
8263	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .	0
8264	The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .	1
8265	Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock 's imaginative flight to Shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff .	1
8266	Takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights .	4
8267	It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .	1
8268	The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .	3
8269	This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .	1
8270	The film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor .	3
8271	If Jews were Catholics , this would be Catechism	2

8273	Shanghai Ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life .	3
8274	Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .	0
8275	I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .	1
8276	Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .	1
8277	A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit .	1
8278	Arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation .	3
8279	Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .	4
8280	But I had a lot of problems with this movie .	1
8281	Takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms .	3
8282	... the plot weaves us into a complex web .	3
8283	The messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .	2
8284	Plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made Miike ... a cult hero .	2
8285	-LRB- The Cockettes -RRB- provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . '	3
8286	An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .	1
8287	In its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .	3
8288	Renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .	4
8289	... if you 're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch Freaks as a matinee .	2
8290	Feels like a cold old man going through the motions .	1
8291	Vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order .	2
8292	The film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .	3
8293	These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people .	4
8294	Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .	1
8295	The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .	3
8296	In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24\/7 .	0
8297	A delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by Michael Gondry .	4
8298	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .	1
8299	Jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema .	3
8300	The fourth `` Pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance .	3
8301	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .	1
8302	... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .	0
8303	... a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor .	2
8304	Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .	0
8305	He 's not good with people .	1
8306	The sheer dumbness of the plot -LRB- other than its one good idea -RRB- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .	0
8307	It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look .	2
8308	Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .	0
8309	Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .	2
8310	Warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message .	4
8311	An eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , ` Spy Kids 2 ' is a visual treat for all audiences .	3
8312	`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .	0
8313	Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .	0
8314	It 's such a mechanical endeavor -LRB- that -RRB- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .	1
8315	And second , what 's with all the shooting ?	1
8316	Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .	1
8317	... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the Warren Report .	2
8318	Rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .	4
8319	There 's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane .	2
8320	Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .	1
8321	The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .	1
8322	The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .	2
8323	Merci pour le movie .	2
8324	Devos and Cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable .	4
8325	Poignant and funny .	3
8326	The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .	1
8327	A glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism .	3
8328	The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .	4
8329	It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .	1
8330	With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .	3
8331	Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?	1
8332	Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?	1
8333	It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .	1
8334	A moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide .	3
8335	A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .	1
8336	When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .	0
8337	A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps Dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions .	3
8338	The movie should be credited with remembering his victims .	2
8339	Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .	1
8340	Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good .	2
8341	Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .	1
8342	The Sweetest Thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways .	2
8343	Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .	3
8344	A chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness .	3
8345	Smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .	3
8346	Succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides .	3
8347	A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .	4
8348	High Crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it ca n't help but engage an audience .	3
8349	Michel Piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being .	3
8350	Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .	0
8351	An intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives .	3
8352	The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .	2
8353	Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .	2
8354	A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .	1
8355	A quietly moving look back at what it was to be Iranian-American in 1979 .	3
8356	Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .	0
8357	... a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department .	4
8358	... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .	1
8359	but ` Why ? '	2
8360	Denis forges out of the theories of class - based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord .	2
8361	If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .	0
8362	While most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that 's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world .	3
8363	She boxes these women 's souls right open for us .	3
8364	In his U.S. debut , Mr. Schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist .	4

8366	It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .	0
8367	Anyone who 's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved .	2
8368	Just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole .	1
8369	And it 's a lousy one at that .	0
8370	Not one moment in the enterprise did n't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow .	2
8371	It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .	2
8372	Between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism .	3
8373	In addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , Changing Lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight .	4
8374	Lasker 's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as Byron and Luther ... realize they ca n't get no satisfaction without the latter .	3
8375	This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .	1
8376	A smart little indie .	3
8377	My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it .	0
8378	Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .	0
8379	this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it 's a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .	2
8380	Whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .	2
8381	The best way to describe it is as a cross between Paul Thomas Anderson 's Magnolia and David Lynch 's Mulholland Dr.	2
8382	harmlessly	3
8383	After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .	1
8384	A powerful performance from Mel Gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an M-16 .	4
8385	So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .	1
8386	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .	0
8387	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .	1
8388	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .	1
8389	Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .	1
8390	The movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .	2
8391	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .	1
8392	One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .	1
8393	A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .	2

8395	In its own floundering way , it gets to you .	3
8396	Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .	1
8397	Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?	1

8399	-LRB- Haynes ' -RRB- homage to such films as `` All That Heaven Allows '' and `` Imitation of Life '' transcends them .	2
8400	Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .	0

8402	A good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold .	3
8403	As self-aware movies go , Who is Cletis Tout ?	2
8404	Britney Spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .	1
8405	Nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin .	3
8406	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?	3
8407	Terminally brain dead production .	0
8408	An interesting look behind the scenes of Chicago-based rock group Wilco ...	3
8409	Has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that Seagal 's overweight and out of shape .	1
8410	A winning and wildly fascinating work .	3
8411	After watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history .	3
8412	Yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .	1
8413	The film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring Kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .	2
8414	Intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being .	3
8415	The whole mildly pleasant outing -- the R rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen .	2
8416	Gondry 's direction is adequate ... but what gives Human Nature its unique feel is Kaufman 's script .	3
8417	This is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood .	3
8418	If you can swallow its absurdities and crudities Lagaan really is enormously good fun .	3
8419	Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .	1
8420	Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .	3
8421	Rob Schneider , Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story ?	2
8422	The acting is n't much better .	0
8423	Zoom !	3
8424	I had more fun with Ben Stiller 's Zoolander , which I thought was rather clever .	2
8425	If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .	3
8426	It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .	3
8427	More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .	4
8428	That 's its first sign of trouble .	1
8429	A very charming and funny movie .	4
8430	A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .	2

8434	The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .	2
8435	A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .	1
8436	Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .	1
8437	The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from Spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .	3
8438	A wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .	3
8439	Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .	2
8440	Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .	1
8441	Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , Warm Water may well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy .	4
8442	Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .	1
8444	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .	0
8445	What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .	0
8446	... by the time it 's done with us , Mira Nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over .	4

8449	Staggeringly dreadful romance .	0
8450	This method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .	4
8451	Weird .	1
8452	Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .	4
8453	Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .	4
8454	The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .	2
8455	And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .	1
8456	The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati .	4
8457	Ill-considered , unholy hokum .	1
8458	Or that the battery on your watch has died .	2
8459	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .	3
8460	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .	0
8461	-LRB- Taylor -RRB- takes us on a ride that 's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .	2
8462	Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .	1
8463	Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .	1
8464	Familiar but utterly delightful .	3
8465	For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .	1
8466	Consider it ` perfection . '	4
8467	At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .	0
8468	This is a more fascinating look at the future than `` Bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .	3
8469	Samuel L. Jackson is one of the best actors there is .	4
8470	Huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling Kathy Baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on Boston Public just as much as 8 Women 's Augustine .	3
8471	But no. .	1
8472	Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .	1
8473	If you love him , you 'll like it .	3
8474	A new film from Bill Plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .	4
8475	There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .	2
8476	The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .	1
8477	Woefully pretentious .	1
8478	Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .	1
8479	Makes one thing abundantly clear .	3
8480	A flick about our infantilized culture that is n't entirely infantile .	3
8481	Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .	1
8482	We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .	1
8483	A ragbag of cliches .	0
8484	It made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters .	3
8485	Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .	3
8486	Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy .	1
8487	And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .	3
8488	Exudes the fizz of a Busby Berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza .	4
8489	For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .	1
8490	An engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement .	3
8491	with a couple of burnt-out cylinders	2

8494	We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .	4
8495	Disgusting .	0
8496	` Moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '	1
8497	Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .	2

8500	Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .	0
8501	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .	2
8502	Mike Leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life	4
8503	If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change .	3
8504	Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	1
8505	It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .	3
8506	Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .	3
8507	Shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .	3
8508	As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .	0
8509	The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .	3
8510	It never rises to its clever what-if concept .	1
8511	Much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice .	3
8512	A sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration .	2
8513	A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .	4
8514	Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .	0
8515	It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .	4
8516	Williams creates a stunning , Taxi Driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .	4
8517	Campbell Scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of Roger Swanson .	3
8518	Has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of B-movie excitement .	3
8519	With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .	1
8520	Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .	3
8521	A witty , whimsical feature debut .	3
8522	Exhilarating , funny and fun .	4
8523	As an entertainment destination for the general public , Kung Pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .	1
8524	Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .	3
8525	None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .	1
8526	The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .	2
8527	Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .	1
8528	It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .	3
8529	The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .	3
8531	Even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , East-vs .	2
8532	The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .	1
8533	Proves a servicable World War II drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem Hollywood too long has ignored .	3
8534	This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .	1
8535	In this case zero .	1
8536	Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .	1
8537	Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .	3
8538	It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .	3
8539	The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .	0
8540	... either you 're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you 're not .	2
8541	Despite these annoyances , the capable Clayburgh and Tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age .	2
8542	-LRB- Tries -RRB- to parody a genre that 's already a joke in the United States .	1
8543	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .	1
