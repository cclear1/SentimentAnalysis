8731	A very average science fiction film .
8732	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
8733	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .

8747	It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right .
8748	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
8749	Despite a story predictable enough to make The Sound of Music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it .

8764	Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .

8809	A clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ... well , just stuff .
8810	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
8811	To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
8812	The Wild Thornberrys Movie is a jolly surprise .
8813	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
8814	A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
8815	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
8816	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
8817	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
8818	It is interesting and fun to see Goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen .
8819	Harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness .
8820	It 's also , clearly , great fun .
8821	The warm presence of Zhao Benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be .
8822	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .
8823	-LRB- Villeneuve -RRB- seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death .
8824	But that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
8825	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
8826	Having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , Khouri then gets terrific performances from them all .
8827	The way Coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .
8828	Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .
8829	... a magnificent drama well worth tracking down .
8830	Schindler 's List it ai n't .
8831	The volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-Hollywood that it seems positively French in its rhythms and resonance .
8832	It 's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives Secret Life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self .
8833	Edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , Pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any MTV puffery .
8834	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
8835	In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .
8836	Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
8837	... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
8838	A delirious celebration of the female orgasm .
8839	Yes , you are , Ben Kingsley .
8840	This is one of Polanski 's best films .
8841	The film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens .
8842	Far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features Nickelodeon has made from its other animated TV series .
8843	The movie is for fans who ca n't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it .
8844	A fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie .
8845	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
8846	Affleck and Jackson are good sparring partners .
8847	I enjoyed the ride -LRB- bumps and all -RRB- , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .
8848	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
8849	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
8850	Turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting .
8851	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
8852	Building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise .
8853	A film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities .
8854	-LRB- U -RRB- nrelentingly stupid .
8855	His healthy sense of satire is light and fun ...
8856	It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
8857	Unfortunately , as a writer , Mr. Montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
8858	Lends itself to the narcotizing bland -LRB- sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial Disney girl movie -RRB- machinations of the biennial Disney boy movie .
8859	It all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
8860	Reinforces the talents of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman , creator of Adaptation and Being John Malkovich .
8861	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
8862	Unlike his directorial efforts , La Femme Nikita and The Professional , The Transporter lacks Besson 's perspective as a storyteller .
8863	`` Antwone Fisher '' is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by Washington .
8864	The invincible Werner Herzog is alive and well and living in LA
8865	The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .
8866	All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
8867	Drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why .
8868	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
8869	It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
8870	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
8871	Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty .
8872	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
8873	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
8874	It 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-Soviet Russia .
8875	An utterly compelling ` who wrote it ' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question .
8876	... Blade II is more enjoyable than the original .
8877	Huppert 's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face .
8878	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
8879	When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .
8880	There are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected -LRB- and gentle -RRB- way .
8881	Accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
8882	I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
8883	First-time writer-director Serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film .
8884	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
8885	Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
8886	The whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like Bellini and Mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .
8887	Genuinely touching because it 's realistic about all kinds of love .
8888	A gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of Moore 's pasteurized ditties
8889	Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
8890	A perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy .
8891	Too slow , too long and too little happens .
8892	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
8893	Does what a fine documentary does best : It extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively .
8894	Though Mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a Jules and Jim for the new millennium .
8895	I tried to read the time on my watch .
8896	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
8897	Bow 's best moments are when he 's getting busy on the basketball court because that 's when he really scores .
8898	This is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the Saturday matinee , and it still is .
8899	Visits spy-movie territory like a novel you ca n't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last .
8900	-LRB- Morgan -RRB- , Judd and Franklin ca n't save the script , rooted in a novel by Joseph Finder , from some opportunism .
8901	`` Men in Black II , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel .
8902	An unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .
8903	I do n't know precisely what to make of Steven Soderbergh 's Full Frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it .
8904	This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
8905	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
8906	With generic sets and B-grade special effects , Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as TV 's defunct Cleopatra 2525 .
8907	`` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
8908	It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
8909	You would n't call The Good Girl a date movie -LRB- an anti-date movie is more like it -RRB- , but when it 's good , it 's good and horrid .
8910	Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
8911	The film starts out as competent but unremarkable ... and gradually grows into something of considerable power .
8912	No. .
8913	A pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that Errol Morris has often dealt with ... it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm .
8914	Works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren .
8915	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
8916	I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .
8917	Manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer .
8918	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
8919	The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
8920	To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
8921	Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
8922	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
8923	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
8924	Watching Beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it .
8925	But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
8926	Not a bad journey at all .
8927	A dreadful live-action movie .
8928	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
8929	In the end , Punch-Drunk Love is one of those films that I wanted to like much more than I actually did .
8930	There 's a vastness implied in Metropolis that is just breathtaking .
8931	I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .
8932	A deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy .
8933	Gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife .
8934	Uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance .
8935	An entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart .
8936	But it could have been worse .
8937	This is her Blue Lagoon .
8938	Candid Camera on methamphetamines .
8939	Very bad .
8940	I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then .
8941	IHOPs do n't pile on this much syrup .
8942	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''
8943	A taut , intelligent psychological drama .
8944	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
8945	Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .
8946	... Tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope .
8947	A truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort .
8948	While not as aggressively impressive as its American counterpart , `` In the Bedroom , '' Moretti 's film makes its own , quieter observations
8949	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
8950	Hopkins .
8951	A very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage .
8952	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
8953	Tsai Ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point .
8954	There are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an Iranian specialty .
8955	Challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative .
8956	Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
8957	Two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more 's the pity .
8958	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
8959	Witty , touching and well paced .
8960	The best film about baseball to hit theaters since Field of Dreams .
8961	Take Care of My Cat offers a refreshingly different slice of Asian cinema .
8962	The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
8963	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
8964	The far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .
8965	Without September 11 , Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie .
8966	This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw : Evil is interesting and good is boring .
8967	It helps that Lil Bow Wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .
8968	A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
8969	The movie 's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast .
8970	One scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce .
8971	The film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task .
8972	This surreal Gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of Ecclesiastes .
8973	It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
8974	The film 's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties .
8975	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
8976	On its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist Byatt .
8977	A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
8978	One long string of cliches .
8979	Apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in Blue Crush in one form or the other .
8980	It has the charm of the original American road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker 's motherland .
8981	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
8982	It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
8983	By the time we learn that Andrew 's Turnabout Is Fair Play is every bit as awful as Borchardt 's Coven , we can enjoy it anyway .
8984	The crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us .
8985	Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
8986	The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
8987	As a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places
8988	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
8989	Featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great Daniel Auteuil , `` Sade '' covers the same period as Kaufmann 's `` Quills '' with more unsettlingly realistic results .
8990	Its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .
8991	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
8992	Barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .
8993	A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...
8994	This is how you use special effects .
8995	Nicolas Philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern France in his documentary To Be and to Have , easily one of the best films of the year .
8996	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
8997	A lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s European-set spy pictures .
8998	Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship .
8999	Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern 's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
9000	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
9001	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
9002	Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
9003	Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
9004	Corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless .
9005	There is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them .
9006	A well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
9007	As Weber and Weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the Cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .
9008	A deep and meaningful film .
9009	The film is all a little Lit Crit 101 , but it 's extremely well played and often very funny .
9010	This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
9011	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
9012	Let 's hope -- shall we ?
9013	Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
9014	It 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .
9015	may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for Astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow .
9016	What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .
9017	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
9018	... In this incarnation its fizz is infectious .
9019	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
9020	Unflinchingly bleak and desperate
9021	But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?
9022	But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .
9023	When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
9024	A moody horror\/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director 's well-known narrative gamesmanship .
9025	I whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone .
9026	Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
9027	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
9028	A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
9029	Just one bad idea after another .
9030	After making several adaptations of other writers ' work , Armenian-Canadian director Atom Egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject .
9031	Not too far below the gloss you can still feel director Denis Villeneuve 's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .
9032	Not since Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa 's Ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur .
9033	It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
9034	A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
9035	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
9036	Few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands .
9037	An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .
9038	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
9039	Bennett 's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that 's tough to shake .
9040	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .
9041	If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
9042	The year 's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way .
9043	While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
9044	Creepy , authentic and dark .
9045	No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
9046	It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
9047	By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
9048	An extraordinary Swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that Bille August does best .
9049	A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
9050	This delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director .
9051	But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
9052	With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious .
9053	That is essentially what 's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
9054	It 's a scathing portrayal .
9055	It has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion .
9056	Japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .
9057	The drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .
9058	Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .
9059	`` The Ring '' is pretty much an English-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws .
9060	It 's haunting .
9061	Generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down .
9062	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
9063	A must-see for the David Mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking .
9064	If Steven Soderbergh 's ` Solaris ' is a failure it is a glorious failure .
9065	You might not buy the ideas .
9066	Invincible is a wonderful movie .
9067	For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
9068	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
9069	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -RRB- .
9070	Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
9071	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
9072	All in all , The Count of Monte Cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .
9073	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
9074	Dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny .
9075	A resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution .
9076	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
9077	Search it out .
9078	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
9079	Presents an astute appraisal of Middle American musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .
9080	A beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in Iran .
9081	Director of photography Benoit Delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand .
9082	just pound away .
9083	There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
9084	Everytime you think Undercover Brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse .
9085	The New Guy is one of them .
9086	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
9087	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
9088	Majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places .
9089	You could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that Alias Betty is predictable .
9090	If there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , I think it 's in projects like the -LRB- unfortunately R-rated -RRB- Paid .
9091	So what is the point ?
9092	A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
9093	It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
9094	If it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life 's urgent questions .
9095	The story may not be new , but Australian director John Polson , making his American feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly .
9096	A sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that is n't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears .
9097	Not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it 's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare .
9098	As an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting .
9099	The Powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question .
9100	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
9101	And just when you think it ca n't get any more gay , in pops Nathan Lane .
9102	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
9103	It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
9104	My Wife Is an Actress is an utterly charming French comedy that feels so American in sensibility and style it 's virtually its own Hollywood remake .
9105	Lee Jeong-Hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that I could n't help being captivated by it .
9106	The experience of watching blobby old-school CGI animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .
9107	It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
9108	The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
9109	A film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : You experience it as you watch .
9110	Smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
9111	This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
9112	What distinguishes Time of Favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts .
9113	If there 's nothing fresh about Wannabes , which was written by Mr. DeMeo , who produced and directed the film with Charles A. Addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic .
9114	Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
9115	Biggie and Tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .
9116	Cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate Vincent 's days
9117	Without resorting to hyperbole , I can state that Kissing Jessica Stein may be the best same-sex romance I have seen .
9118	Still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .
9119	Not exactly the Bees Knees
9120	Griffiths proves she 's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .
9121	A breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat .
9122	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
9123	Working from Elliott 's memoir , Rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character - and - relationship study he 's favored for decades .
9124	This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
9125	A little too pat for its own good .
9126	The Chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between Gauls and Yanks .
9127	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
9128	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
9129	A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
9130	Makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun .
9131	The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
9132	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
9133	It 's a pleasure to see Seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies Chris Rock , Garry Shandling and Colin Quinn .
9134	That 's a cheat .
9135	A splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience .
9136	Earns its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the Elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing .
9137	A coda in every sense , The Pinochet Case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the British court 's extradition chess game and the regime 's talking-head survivors .
9138	They felt like the same movie to me .
9139	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
9140	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
9141	sympathetically captures the often futile lifestyle of young people in modern Japan .
9142	A triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !
9143	A whole lot foul , freaky and funny .
9144	While -LRB- Hill -RRB- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
9145	By candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , -LRB- Jones -RRB- calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity .
9146	A rarity among recent Iranian films : It 's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist 's plight .
9148	You wo n't miss its messages , but you 'll be entertained as well .
9149	Has a shambling charm ... a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .
9150	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
9151	A refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary American film .
9152	You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
9153	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
9154	-LRB- Broomfield -RRB- uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue .
9155	Is this love or is it masochism ?
9156	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
9157	Rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic .
9158	As vulgar as it is banal .
9159	Never -LRB- sinks -RRB- into exploitation .
9160	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
9161	A psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by Al Pacino .
9162	So few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
9163	It treats women like idiots .
9164	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
9165	This may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other Holocaust films , but it 's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it 's told by the people who were there .
9166	With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
9167	This is art paying homage to art .
9168	That rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind .
9169	Merchant effectively translates Naipaul 's lively mix of characters from the page to screen .
9170	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
9171	It 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
9172	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
9173	Daughter from Danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who are n't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war .
9174	something the true film buff will enjoy .
9175	A poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality .
9176	Even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate .
9177	A touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .
9178	-LRB- A -RRB- Hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning ... -LRB- but -RRB- Lohman 's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer ...
9179	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
9180	Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .
9181	It 's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman .
9182	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
9183	The people in Dogtown and Z-Boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you ca n't wait to see what they do next .
9184	Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
9185	Still , I thought it could have been more .
9186	A grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama .
9187	As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
9188	Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .
9189	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
9190	It 's fascinating to see how Bettany and McDowell play off each other .
9191	Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
9192	Interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , Hopkins and Norton are a winning combination -- but Fiennes steals ` Red Dragon ' right from under their noses .
9193	A highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . .
9194	-LRB- Grant 's -RRB- bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle .
9195	This boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of Chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .
9196	As green-guts monster movies go , it 's a beaut .
9197	that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
9198	While it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it 's alarmingly current .
9199	It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
9200	It 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn .
9201	I loved looking at this movie .
9202	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
9203	Tailored to entertain !
9204	Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
9205	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
9206	The level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter .
9207	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
9208	Bears is bad .
9209	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
9210	Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
9211	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
9212	An amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail .
9213	None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
9214	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
9215	Occasionally funny , always very colorful and
9216	A waste of good performances .
9217	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
9218	The whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .
9219	She must have a very strong back .
9220	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
9221	Occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new .
9222	A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
9223	No question .
9224	I admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending .
9225	The movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .
9226	So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
9227	The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
9228	A muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that .
9229	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
9230	Pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived Dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical .
9231	... a roller-coaster ride of a movie
9232	There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
9233	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
9234	The film 's performances are thrilling .
9235	A teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .
9236	Andy Garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and Mick Jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , Performance .
9237	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
9238	A wonderful character-based comedy .
9239	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
9240	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
9241	The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
9242	Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
9243	Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .
9244	It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
9245	An enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the ` truth ' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that Derrida would doubtless give his blessing to .
9246	Nearly surreal , dabbling in French , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it .
9247	Or , you can do something fun tonight .
9248	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
9249	But fans should have fun meeting a brand-new Pokemon called Celebi .
9250	A carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling -- but unquestionably alive .
9251	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
9252	Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .
9253	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
9254	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
9255	There 's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate .
9256	As your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
9257	An unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story .
9258	All the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , All or Nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit .
9259	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
9260	Ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
9261	If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
9262	4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer they can drink - it 's the ultimate redneck road-trip .
9263	But in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .
9264	Sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film .
9265	Dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness -LRB- which always relates to characters and story -RRB- and Johnny Dankworth 's best soundtrack in years .
9266	An enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside St. Petersburg 's Hermitage Museum .
9267	It has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .
9268	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
9269	The film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
9270	Almost everything else is wan .
9271	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
9272	The movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .
9273	A poignant and compelling story about relationships , Food of Love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart .
9274	Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
9275	... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .
9276	Majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
9277	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
9278	It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
9279	This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
9280	What better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ?
9281	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
9282	A lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
9283	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
9284	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
9285	Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
9286	A thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 .
9287	It 's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .
9288	A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
9289	The central story lacks punch .
9290	Extremely boring .
9291	Britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway .
9292	Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
9293	Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .
9294	As unseemly as its title suggests .
9295	Jose Campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory .
9296	The socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides ... -LRB- and -RRB- personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy .
9297	A mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin 's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
9298	Even if the ride 's a little bumpy , with a final lap that 's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director Roger Michell , best known for the superfluous Notting Hill , credit for trying .
9299	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .
9300	With the film 's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved .
9301	An intelligent , moving and invigorating film .
9302	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
9303	... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
9304	A work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense .
9305	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
9306	Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
9307	As a singular character study , it 's perfect .
9308	An impossible romance , but we root for the patronized Iranian lad .
9309	Usually when I get this much syrup , I like pancakes to go with it .
9310	In its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works .
9311	But watching Huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting .
9312	A moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , Solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate .
9313	Tuck Everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .
9314	Beneath Clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from Rabbit-Proof Fence .
9315	Is n't it great ?
9316	Leigh 's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom .
9317	I 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
9318	A rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers .
9319	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate .
9320	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
9321	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
9322	Has all the depth of a wading pool .
9323	If The Count of Monte Cristo does n't transform Caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago .
9324	Once -LRB- Kim -RRB- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
9325	It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .
9326	There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
9327	The comic performances are all spot on , especially Lee Ross 's turn as Ken .
9328	For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
9329	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
9330	He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
9331	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
9332	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
9333	a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
9334	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
9335	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
9336	At nearly three hours , the whole of Safe Conduct is less than the sum of its parts .
9337	The draw -LRB- for `` Big Bad Love '' -RRB- is a solid performance by Arliss Howard .
9338	Although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there 's no denying the fun of watching De Niro and Crystal having fun .
9339	Starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end .
9340	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
9341	Whatever Eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
9342	Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
9343	Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
9344	Thanks to Scott 's charismatic Roger and Eisenberg 's sweet nephew , Roger Dodger is one of the most compelling variations on In the Company of Men .
9345	Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
9346	It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
9347	A great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy need n't always make us laugh .
9348	What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
9349	It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
9350	Rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as Monsoon Wedding .
9351	Bad .
9352	in Imax 3-D
9353	The second chapter of the Harry Potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year .
9354	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
9355	Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
9356	-LRB- Gai -RRB- comes closer to any actress I can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form .
9357	Woody Allen 's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .
9358	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
9359	... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but George Pal 's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs .
9360	Oh , it 's extreme , all right .
9361	What happens to John Q ?
9362	Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
9363	The story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions .
9364	The vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination .
9365	Behind the snow games and lovable Siberian huskies -LRB- plus one sheep dog -RRB- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .
9366	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
9367	A movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair .
9368	With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris , not to mention Sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate Fire 's bright side .
9369	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
9370	A thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film .
9371	The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
9372	Although German cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world 's best cuisine , Mostly Martha could make Deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists .
9373	A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .
9374	A gorgeous , witty , seductive movie .
9375	But I was n't .
9376	For the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride .
9377	Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
9378	s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results .
9379	What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
9380	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
9381	Frida 's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it 's among the most breathtakingly designed films I 've ever seen .
9382	We know the plot 's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish .
9383	It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
9384	Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
9385	A sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss .
9386	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
9387	Once again , director Jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action\/effects on the spectacular scale .
9388	A model of what films like this should be like .
9389	Its direction , its script , and Weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for .
9390	It 's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again .
9391	The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
9392	Disney 's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem .
9393	Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
9394	To say Analyze That is De Niro 's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
9395	There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
9396	Too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience .
9397	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
9398	Only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : Anthony .
9399	Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
9400	Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
9401	What might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity .
9402	Puts a human face on a land most Westerners are unfamiliar with .
9403	The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups .
9404	Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
9405	Like Leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable .
9406	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
9407	Smith profiles five extraordinary American homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .
9408	It 's a charming and often affecting journey .
9409	It 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .
9410	Over age 15 ?
9411	A densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among Jean-Luc Godard 's finest work .
9412	Lead provocatuers Testud and Parmentier give superlative performances
9413	Yes , Ballistic is silly .
9414	Maybe it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... But honestly , Analyze That really is n't all that bad .
9415	A big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion .
9416	Is this progress ?
9417	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
9418	The film 's center will not hold .
9419	Long after you leave Justine , you 'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean .
9420	It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
9421	Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
9422	A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .
9423	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
9424	-LRB- T -RRB- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the Stepford Wives mentality does n't work in a modern context .
9425	Few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness .
9426	It is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .
9427	And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
9428	But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
9429	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
9430	Holy mad maniac in a mask , Splat-Man !
9431	A pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking .
9432	Ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a Communion wafer without the wine .
9433	Would n't one about their famous dad , author of Death in Venice , etc. , be more valuable ?
9434	Westfeldt and Juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that 's both saucy and endearing .
9435	Writer\/director Joe Carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic .
9436	There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
9437	What happened with Pluto Nash ?
9438	About a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological .
9439	A strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
9440	The film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
9441	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
9442	Eventually , it wins you over .
9443	... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
9444	A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
9445	It 's astonishing .
9446	The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it .
9447	Human Resources was a good , straightforward tale , but Time Out is better .
9448	Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
9449	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
9450	It is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .
9451	One of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year .
9452	Winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
9453	Not always too whimsical for its own good -LRB- but enough to do harm -RRB- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
9454	Stevenson 's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination .
9455	A map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master 's steady stroke .
9456	Perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
9457	Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
9458	For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
9459	Like Mike does n't win any points for originality .
9460	... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
9461	`` My god , I 'm behaving like an idiot ! ''
9462	The tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable .
9463	Offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .
9464	For anyone who grew up on Disney 's 1950 Treasure Island , or remembers the 1934 Victor Fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
9465	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
9466	Still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
9467	... a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .
9468	Cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .
9469	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
9470	It uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding .
9471	Soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
9472	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
9473	A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
9474	An idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone .
9475	Still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .
9476	Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
9477	As a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a Triumph , however , it is not .
9478	It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
9479	Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , Kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .
9480	The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
9481	Socrates motions for hemlock .
9482	A strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama .
9483	It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -LRB- and an uneasy alliance , at that -RRB- .
9484	Pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura .
9485	Audrey Tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and
9486	It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
9487	The movie is full of fine performances , led by Josef Bierbichler as Brecht and Monica Bleibtreu as Helene Weigel , his wife .
9488	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
9489	Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
9490	It 's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it 's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep .
9491	The result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor .
9492	Polished Korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as Hollywood action epics .
9493	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
9494	On the heels of The Ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness .
9495	You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
9496	Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
9497	Frenetic but not really funny .
9498	His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .
9499	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
9500	I wonder why .
9501	Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
9502	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
9503	I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
9504	It provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .
9505	Whether you 're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you 'll still feel something .
9506	There has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes .
9507	There was time on that second round to see the subtleties of Ramsay 's portrait of grief .
9508	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
9509	Old-form moviemaking at its best .
9510	It 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain .
9511	It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
9512	The movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances .
9513	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
9514	All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
9515	Noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .
9516	... there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen .
9517	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
9518	If it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than Half Past Dead .
9519	Offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude .
9520	The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
9521	A compendium of Solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
9522	The movie is n't always easy to look at .
9523	But it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .
9524	While locals will get a kick out of spotting Cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning Coen brothers envious .
9525	The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -LRB- and torturing -RRB- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .
9526	You do n't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable B-minus to The Emperor 's Club .
9527	Provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of Todd Solondz .
9528	-LRB- Hawn 's character -RRB- is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten .
9529	Though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical Miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes .
9530	Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
9531	A cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .
9532	Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots .
9533	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
9534	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .
9535	... has virtually no script at all ...
9536	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
9537	... the film suffers from a lack of humor -LRB- something needed to balance out the violence -RRB- ...
9538	It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
9539	Not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .
9540	With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
9541	The film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as Cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin .
9542	And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
9543	The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
9544	Seldahl 's Barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness .
9545	It turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting .
9546	Compelling as it is exotic , Fast Runner has a plot that rivals Shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder .
9547	Brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition .
9548	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
9549	Will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues .
9550	It is so refreshing to see Robin Williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he 's been making for the last several years .
9551	Highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved Cool as Ice have at last found a worthy follow-up .
9552	A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
9553	There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
9554	Possession is Elizabeth Barrett Browning meets Nancy Drew , and it 's directed by ... Neil LaBute .
9555	It 's just incredibly dull .
9556	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
9557	... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
9558	This is it .
9559	Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
9560	There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
9561	What it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and B-grade stylishness .
9562	While The Isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at .
9563	` They ' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying I 'm still stunned .
9564	The acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales .
9565	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
9566	The band 's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies -LRB- this one included -RRB- .
9567	While Undisputed is n't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes Mr. Hill higher than he 's been in a while .
9568	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
9569	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
9570	Gloriously goofy -LRB- and gory -RRB- midnight movie stuff .
9571	... understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation .
9572	At times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
9573	The actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them .
9574	... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
9575	An incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams .
9576	I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
9577	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
9578	It 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be .
9579	Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a quirky and poignant Japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality .
9580	It 's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it 's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit .
9581	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
9582	The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .
9583	Well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .
9584	Against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine .
9585	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
9586	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
9587	If you liked such movies as Notting Hill , Four Weddings And A Funeral , Bridget Jones ' Diary or High Fidelity , then you wo n't want to miss About A Boy .
9588	While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -LRB- Sugar Hill Gang , etc. -RRB- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
9589	These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
9590	About as cutting-edge as Pet Rock : The Movie .
9591	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
9592	Falls neatly into the category of Good Stupid Fun .
9593	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
9594	An inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of Vietnamese refugees living in U.S. relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 .
9595	Reggio 's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .
9596	The talents of the actors helps `` Moonlight Mile '' rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing .
9597	At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
9598	He simply presents his point of view that Ayurveda works .
9599	A full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .
9600	It 's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be .
9601	An enchanting spectacular for Potter fans anxious to ride the Hogwarts Express toward a new year of magic and mischief .
9602	It just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read Stevenson 's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .
9603	It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
9604	Though the controversial Korean filmmaker 's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding .
9605	The pleasures of Super Troopers may be fleeting , but they 'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor .
9606	This is Carion 's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach .
9607	Pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins .
9608	Greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
9609	It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
9610	-LRB- Chaiken 's -RRB- talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters .
9611	A somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race .
9612	These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
9613	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
9614	Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
9615	Further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of Dubya 's Axis of Evil .
9616	There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
9617	Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
9618	Although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women .
9619	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
9620	There is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them .
9621	It 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
9622	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
9623	Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
9624	It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
9625	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
9626	Easier to respect than enthuse over , Andersson 's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing .
9627	Viewed on its own terms , Treasure Planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the Stevenson 's novel will likely prefer Disney 's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic .
9628	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
9629	Emerges as something rare , an issue movie that 's so honest and keenly observed that it does n't feel like one .
9630	At its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers .
9631	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
9632	More than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling .
9633	A boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
9634	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
9635	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year 's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
9636	It 's a lovely film with lovely performances by Buy and Accorsi .

9638	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
9639	Who needs love like this ?
9640	84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare .
9641	The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
9642	So , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today 's New Delhi .
9643	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
9644	More honest about Alzheimer 's disease , I think , than Iris .
9645	An awkward and indigestible movie .
9646	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
9647	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
9648	One of the best of the year .
9649	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
9650	An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .
9651	... always remains movingly genuine .
9652	Watching Haneke 's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment .
9653	This is a winning ensemble comedy that shows Canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world .
9654	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
9655	All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .
9656	For starters , the story is just too slim .
9657	When the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
9658	There is a kind of attentive concern that Hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital .
9659	A mess when it comes to the characters and writing ... but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory .
9660	Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
9661	Nolan bravely treads where few American films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ...
9662	Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
9663	A classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done .
9664	Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
9665	No sophomore slump for director Sam Mendes , who segues from Oscar winner to Oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .
9666	Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
9667	The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
9668	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
9669	Far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning .
9670	We learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef .
9671	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
9672	Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .
9673	For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
9674	A twisty , moody slice of Southern Gothic ...
9675	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
9676	An epic of grandeur and scale that 's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of Hollywood .
9677	The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -LRB- most notably wretched sound design -RRB- .
9678	That 's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan 's existence .
9679	Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
9680	At all .
9681	The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
9682	The best movie of its kind since ` Brazil . '
9683	Choose your reaction : A. -RRB- That sure is funny !
9684	Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
9685	Not everything works , but the average is higher than in Mary and most other recent comedies .
9686	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
9687	The movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow .
9688	Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
9689	A hip ride into hyper-time , Clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time .
9690	Grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte .

9692	Ahhhh ... revenge is sweet !
9693	Flawed but worthy look at life in U.S. relocation camps .
9694	... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
9695	-LRB- A -RRB- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .
9696	You will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report .
9697	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
9698	Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
9699	Almost gags on its own gore .
9700	It 's obviously struck a responsive chord with many South Koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world .
9701	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
9702	If you love Motown music , you 'll love this documentary .
9703	Much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .
9704	This is what IMAX was made for : Strap on a pair of 3-D goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space .
9705	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
9706	Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
9707	This is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other .
9708	Girls gone wild and gone civil again
9709	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
9710	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
9711	Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
9712	... an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly should n't hurt talented young Gaghan 's resume .
9713	Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time .
9714	While the stoically delivered hokum of Hart 's War is never fun , it 's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-Saving Private Ryan tributes to the greatest generation .
9715	The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
9716	Mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun .
9717	The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
9718	`` The Mothman Prophecies '' is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls .
9719	This is a very fine movie -- go see it .
9720	Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
9721	Whether you like rap music or loathe it , you ca n't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie .
9722	Likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer .
9723	An absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss .
9724	Lucas , take notes .
9725	Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
9726	But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
9727	This is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema 's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable .
9728	A thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty .
9729	Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
9730	An impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent .
9731	Smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .
9732	A refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale .
9733	None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
9734	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .
9735	A rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love .
9736	We need -LRB- Moore 's -RRB- noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones .
9737	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
9738	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
9739	Part Three Stooges .
9740	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
9741	It 's painful .
9742	It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
9743	This road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you 'll be glad you went along for the ride .
9744	Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
9745	If no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .
9746	Broomfield turns his distinctive ` blundering ' style into something that could really help clear up the case .
9747	If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
9748	For the most part , it 's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions .
9749	... -LRB- like -RRB- channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
9750	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
9751	Though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters .
9752	Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
9753	It 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most American representations of Castro .
9754	A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .
9755	A delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , Read My Lips is an original .
9756	Despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -LRB- Seinfeld 's -RRB- revered TV show , about pretty much nothing .
9757	It deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .
9758	Has the feel of an unedited personal journal .
9759	More romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original .
9760	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
9761	An absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true .
9762	While the glass slipper does n't quite fit , Pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale .
9763	Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .
9764	A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
9765	Whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of Steve Irwin are priceless entertainment .
9766	Thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the Croc Hunter agenda .
9767	Bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves .
9768	Although very much like the first movie based on J.K. Rowling 's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude .
9769	It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
9770	Just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat .
9771	And forget about any attempt at a plot !
9772	We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
9773	An enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable Italian comedy Big Deal on Madonna Street .
9774	But he somehow pulls it off .
9775	A masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview .
9776	The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
9777	focuses on Joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with Spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that I became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
9778	Only an epic documentary could get it all down , and Spike Lee 's Jim Brown : All American at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .
9779	My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor .
9780	Teen movies have really hit the skids .
9781	It will grip even viewers who are n't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of American society in an unnerving way .
9782	As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
9783	We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
9784	On this tricky topic , Tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .
9785	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
9786	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
9787	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
9788	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
9789	Despite its flaws , Secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions .
9790	One of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever .
9791	If you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
9792	Not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen .
9793	Looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in Jane Hamilton 's exemplary costumes , Rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . '
9794	Passable entertainment , but it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .
9795	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
9796	A tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man 's tortured soul .
9797	An endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years .
9798	A movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship Lil ' Bow Wow .
9799	Fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots .
9800	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .
9801	The magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances .
9802	If nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .
9803	The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .
9804	The movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes .
9805	B. -RRB- That sure is pathetic !
9806	Sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling .
9807	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
9808	A smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy .
9809	Lathan and Diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .
9810	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
9811	For the most part Stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue .
9812	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
9813	Oh come on .
9814	A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
9815	A literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 .
9816	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
9817	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
9818	Workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies .
9819	For the first time in several years , Mr. Allen has surpassed himself with the magic he 's spun with the Hollywood empress of Ms. Leoni 's Ellie .
9820	Occasionally melodramatic , it 's also extremely effective .
9821	An intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected .
9822	Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .
9823	I do n't think I laughed out loud once .
9824	Much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , Haneke has a different objective in mind -- namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation .
9825	A remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution .
9826	Thanks to Haynes ' absolute control of the film 's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , Far From Heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act .
9827	Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and What Time Is It There ?
9828	It 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
9829	If you 've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is .
9830	Anchored by a terrific performance by Abbass , Satin Rouge shows that the idea of women 's self-actualization knows few continental divides .
9831	The smartest bonehead comedy of the summer .
9832	As a director , Mr. Ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects .
9833	An appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles .
9834	All but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure .
9835	This is nothing but familiar territory .
9836	A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
9837	Based on a devilishly witty script by Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
9838	Funny but perilously slight .
9839	For Benigni it was n't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
9840	Waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality .
9841	At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the '60s .
9842	It 's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children .
9843	From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
9844	Renner 's performance as Dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing .
9845	despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! ''
9846	It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .
9847	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .
9848	Sometimes , that 's enough .
9849	The acting alone is worth the price of admission .
9850	Wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
9851	K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
9852	Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
9853	Aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better .
9854	A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
9855	Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
9856	It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
9857	This is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man .
9858	This is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio 's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed .
9859	Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .
9860	Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
9861	Ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family 's custom-made Christmas card .
9862	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
9863	Remember when Bond had more glamour than clamor ?
9864	Aside from being the funniest movie of the year , Simone , Andrew Niccol 's brilliant anti-Hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it .
9865	If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
9866	It 's an awfully derivative story .
9867	Does n't amount to much of anything .
9868	It wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor .
9869	Extremely dumb .
9870	Wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -LRB- like one of Hubert 's punches -RRB- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
9871	Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
9872	Fans of Nijinsky will savor every minute of Cox 's work .
9873	The principals in this cast are all fine , but Bishop and Stevenson are standouts .
9874	The format gets used best ... to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and BMX riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups .
9875	Painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year 's most accomplished and riveting film performances .
9876	Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
9877	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
9878	Karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat .
9879	If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
9880	Elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by Per Christian Ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone .
9881	Here , thankfully , they are .
9882	Chalk it up to my adoration for both De Niro and Murphy , but I had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws .
9883	Exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran Bouquet and the chilling but quite human Berling .
9884	Offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works .
9885	As lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled Nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that George Lucas has long forgotten .
9886	Engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship .
9887	There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
9888	Lilia 's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but Abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth .
9889	Though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .
9890	One Hour Photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it 's just too bad it does n't have more flashes of insight .
9891	For the first time in years , De Niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he 's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars .
9892	Hilariously inept and ridiculous .
9893	The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .
9894	Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
9895	Basically a static series of semi-improvised -LRB- and semi-coherent -RRB- raps between the stars .
9896	An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
9897	It never fails to engage us .
9898	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
9899	An original gem about an obsession with time .
9900	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
9901	Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
9902	It all adds up to good fun .
9903	The sort of film that makes me miss Hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there 's hope for popular cinema yet .
9904	As blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , El Bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance .
9905	You might not want to hang out with Samantha , but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story .
9906	A psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor Bill Paxton 's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural Americana .
9907	That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
9908	The saturation bombing of Reggio 's images and Glass ' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning .
9909	Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
9910	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .

9912	It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
9913	Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .

9915	... a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism .
9916	May be far from the best of the series , but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .
9917	It 's just filler .
9918	At times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it 's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do .
9919	Ms. Fulford-Wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating Lolita turn .
9920	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
9921	This is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary !
9922	Sorry , Charlie
9923	Crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action .
9924	Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
9925	The most compelling Wiseman epic of recent years .
9926	The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
9927	Dolgin and Franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a Vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-American girl with a brand new name in southern Tennessee .
9928	The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
9929	Liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , Goodfellas image .
9930	Like a south-of-the-border Melrose Place .
9931	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
9932	Smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities .

9936	The thrill is -LRB- long -RRB- gone .
9937	A gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing .
9938	Shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic .
9939	`` Collateral Damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
9940	The reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that Myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .
9941	-LRB- Wendigo is -RRB- why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind .
9942	One of the smartest takes on singles culture I 've seen in a long time .
9943	Chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution .
9944	The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
9945	Son of the Bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
9946	This film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .
9947	The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
9948	... Brian De Palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad .
9949	-LRB- T -RRB- his beguiling Belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why .
9950	It 's a coming-of-age story we 've all seen bits of in other films -- but it 's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity .
9951	Time Changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
9952	It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
9953	For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
9954	A refreshing Korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters .

9957	He 's Super Spy !
9958	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
9959	What really surprises about Wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness .

9961	Legendary Irish writer Brendan Behan 's memoir , Borstal Boy , has been given a loving screen transferral .
9962	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
9963	Zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure .
9964	A subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; The Pianist does not .
9965	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
9966	A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
9967	Complex , affecting and uniquely
9968	Rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , Les Destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
9969	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
9970	For all its serious sense of purpose ... -LRB- it -RRB- finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor .
9971	A love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats .
9972	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
9973	Morton uses her face and her body language to bring us Morvern 's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan .
9974	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
9975	As -LRB- the characters -RRB- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
9976	A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
9977	It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
9978	I believe the message is in the messenger : The agent is a woman .
9979	It 's endearing to hear Madame D. refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .

9981	Fancy a real downer ?
9982	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
9983	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
9984	The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous -LRB- but with bears , and a G rating -RRB- , with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
9985	A charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind .
9986	A movie with a real anarchic flair .
9987	A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
9988	Several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare .
9989	An effectively creepy , fear-inducing -LRB- not fear-reducing -RRB- film from Japanese director Hideo Nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it .
9990	Even if you do n't think -LRB- Kissinger 's -RRB- any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch .
9991	Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
9992	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
9993	Clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie .
9994	Even in its most tedious scenes , Russian Ark is mesmerizing .
9995	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
9996	All 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .
9997	Cool ?
9998	Zhang Yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it 's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones .
9999	It 's a trifle .
10000	columns from Ladies Home Journal ...
10001	So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
10002	This insightful , Oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance .
10003	An interesting story with a pertinent -LRB- cinematically unique -RRB- message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , I found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive `` missing thing . ''
10004	A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .
10005	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
10006	The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
10007	The Transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
10008	Or emptying rat traps .
10009	It 's unnerving to see Recoing 's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment .
10010	While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
10011	Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
10012	-LRB- A -RRB- n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the Disney comedies from the 60s .
10013	The film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of Joan 's madness .
10014	It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
10015	Maguire is a surprisingly effective Peter\/Spider-Man .
10016	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
10017	... an inviting piece of film .
10018	directed the stage version of Elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage .
10019	Do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman does n't work ?
10020	Full Frontal is the antidote for Soderbergh fans who think he 's gone too commercial since his two Oscar nominated films in 2000
10021	Although the editing might have been tighter , Hush !
10022	The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman -LRB- the actor -RRB- can make it work .
10023	A graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined .
10024	A disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by Philip Glass .
10025	The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
10026	Ultimately , the message of Trouble Every Day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis .
10027	It takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding .
10028	Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
10029	You can practically smell the patchouli oil .
10030	Allows us to hope that Nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker .
10031	A dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble .
10032	Most of Crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness .
10033	It does n't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . ''
10034	Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
10035	The movie makes absolutely no sense .
10036	A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
10037	His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
10038	Unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most Hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of Italian for Beginners .
10039	The Pianist is a fine valedictory work for Polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
10040	Two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated .
10041	Guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .
10042	This one 's weaker than most .
10043	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
10044	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
10045	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
10046	Yes , dull .
10047	An exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world .
10048	A study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers ...
10049	Its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller .
10050	Now it 's just tired .
10051	A modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence .
10052	There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
10053	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
10054	The characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory .
10055	Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
10056	The film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess .
10057	John McTiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
10058	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
10059	By the end of No Such Thing the audience , like Beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster .
10060	Travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .
10061	If I had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong .
10062	This is so bad .
10063	Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .
10064	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
10065	A simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
10066	Although Life or Something Like It is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director Stephen Herek 's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles .
10067	All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
10068	The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
10069	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
10070	To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
10071	Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
10072	A hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations .
10073	Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
10074	It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
10075	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
10076	The inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth .
10077	A cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ... the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .
10078	But it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .
10079	This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
10080	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
10081	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?
10082	-LRB- Fessenden -RRB- is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
10083	Often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , Hell House is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed .
10084	Hmm .
10085	It 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
10086	Windtalkers blows this way and that , but there 's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself .
10087	It 's hard to imagine Alan Arkin being better than he is in this performance .
10088	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
10089	-LRB- Director -RRB- Byler may yet have a great movie in him , but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one .
10090	Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
10091	Yakusho and Shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in Imamura 's lively and enjoyable cultural mix .
10092	Filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels .
10093	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
10094	the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries .
10095	Light , cute and forgettable .
10096	This is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .
10097	... both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
10098	This cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap .
10099	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
10100	Sam Jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day Wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man 's ruin may be another 's fortune .
10101	There can be no other explanation .
10102	Very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary .
10103	Longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days .
10104	Gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive .
10105	Atom Egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
10106	A romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores .
10107	Denis and co-writer Michele Petin 's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing .
10108	People cinema at its finest .
10109	-LRB- I -RRB- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .
10110	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
10111	What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
10112	Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
10113	Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
10114	Asia authors herself as Anna Battista , an Italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy .
10115	This movie is maddening .
10116	The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
10117	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
10118	It 's one heck of a character study -- not of Hearst or Davies but of the unique relationship between them .
10119	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
10120	-LRB- D -RRB- oes n't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical Christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful .
10121	Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .
10122	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
10123	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
10124	Half Submarine flick , Half Ghost Story , All in one criminally neglected film
10125	Entertains by providing good , lively company .
10126	A cartoon that 's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that 's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore .
10127	Day is not a great Bond movie , but it is a good Bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical Bond knock-offs .
10128	It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
10129	A film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world .
10130	Watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
10131	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
10132	This movie is a snow emergency .
10133	Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
10134	Despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is Amy 's self-absorbed personality -- Amy 's O 's honesty will win you over .
10135	New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
10136	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
10137	A droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling .
10138	It 's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice .
10139	There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
10140	Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
10141	A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
10142	Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
10143	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
10144	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
10145	No one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best .
10146	Here , Adrian Lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .
10147	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
10148	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
10149	The actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
10150	As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
10151	Without heavy-handedness , Dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions .
10152	Ranks among Willams ' best screen work .
10153	Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
10154	This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .
10155	The film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
10156	\/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !
10157	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
10158	A woman 's pic directed with resonance by Ilya Chaiken .
10159	Pray 's film works well and will appeal even to those who are n't too familiar with turntablism .
10160	Absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .
10161	It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
10162	The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
10163	A silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
10164	What could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale -- as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters .
10165	... a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war .
10166	Hayek is stunning as Frida and ... a star-making project .
10167	A work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director Eric Byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy .
10168	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
10169	This is as powerful a set of evidence as you 'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives .
10170	It is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some .
10171	The very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director Sprecher .
10172	` Easily my choice for one of the year 's best films . '
10173	A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
10174	The 3D images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
10175	A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years .
10176	It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
10177	A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .
10178	Katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
10179	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
10180	It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
10181	A bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of Philip Glass .
10182	the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality
10183	The scope of the Silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .
10184	The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman -LRB- who never gets to play that flute -RRB- has all the charm of a meltdown .
10185	It 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that Hollywood too rarely provides .
10186	All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .
10187	This disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget .
10188	Droll caper-comedy remake of `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' that 's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` Bellini '' begins to look like a `` real Kaputschnik . ''
10189	The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .
10190	-LRB- W -RRB- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .
10191	... a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original .
10192	The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
10193	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
10194	It haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .
10195	There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
10196	Flavorful and romantic , you could call this How Martha Got Her Groove Back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with .
10197	In scope , ambition and accomplishment , Children of the Century ... takes Kurys ' career to a whole new level .
10198	If director Michael Dowse only superficially understands his characters , he does n't hold them in contempt .
10199	Noyce 's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective .
10200	... does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters ' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought .
10201	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
10202	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
10203	An imaginative comedy\/thriller .
10204	Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
10205	A psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive 's attention to detail .
10206	It 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant .
10207	A TV episode inflated past its natural length .
10208	In all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been .
10209	Among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation .
10210	Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
10211	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
10212	Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
10213	Sits uneasily as a horror picture ... but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family .
10214	A tender , heartfelt family drama .
10215	I have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but I 've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than I want to believe .
10216	Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
10217	Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -LRB- or during -RRB- consumption of its second half .
10218	Compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady .
10219	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
10220	A clever blend of fact and fiction .
10221	But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .
10222	It would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in Talk to Her , the women are down for the count .
10223	Big deal !
10224	Still , I 'm not quite sure what the point is ...
10225	The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
10226	Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
10227	... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
10228	Then lower them a bit more .
10229	If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .
10230	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
10231	While its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer 's appetite , the film 's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving .
10232	... a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of Jean Reno .
10233	Rare Birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable .
10234	I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
10235	I had to look away - this was god awful .
10236	Maneuvers skillfully through the plot 's hot brine -- until it 's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors .
10237	It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
10238	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
10239	The Hours is what movies are supposed to be ...
10240	Majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .
10241	It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
10242	The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .
10243	You 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
10244	Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler 's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
10245	What will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
10246	After that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
10247	Another one of those estrogen overdose movies like `` Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood , '' except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better .
10248	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
10249	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
10250	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
10251	With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
10252	If the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care .
10253	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .
10254	Writer-director 's Mehta 's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres .
10255	But if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than Leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here .
10256	Overall very good for what it 's trying to do .
10257	Frailty is n't as gory or explicit .
10258	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
10259	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
10260	A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
10261	The piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to Anspaugh 's three lead actresses .
10262	It wo n't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking .
10263	There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
10264	Hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic .
10265	Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .
10266	Jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma .
10267	There 's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
10268	If there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam .
10269	The AM-radio soundtrack and game cast -- Tierney and the inimitable Walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
10270	... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
10271	Unlike most teen flicks , Swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity .
10272	CQ 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best European directors .
10273	This film is full of rabbits .
10274	Ray Liotta and Jason Patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : Nobody deserves any prizes here .
10275	This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
10276	Goyer 's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .
10277	` Enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
10278	Writhing under dialogue like ` You 're from two different worlds ' and ` Tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .
10279	It has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it 's over .
10280	Just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever .
10281	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
10282	An exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , Minority Report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
10283	Think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .
10284	A very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth .
10285	Hip-hop has a history , and it 's a metaphor for this love story .
10286	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
10287	Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .
10288	Manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas .
10289	If you 're not into the Pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years wo n't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open .
10290	I do n't think I 've been as entranced and appalled by an Asian film since Shinya Tsukamoto 's Iron Man .
10291	-LRB- T -RRB- here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , Anne Rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
10292	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
10293	A marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption .
10294	Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances .
10295	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
10296	There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
10297	The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
10298	Woo 's fights have a distinct flair .
10299	This one does .
10300	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
10301	Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .
10302	Acting , particularly by Tambor , almost makes `` Never Again '' worthwhile , but -LRB- writer\/director -RRB- Schaeffer should follow his titular advice
10303	An earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
10304	Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
10305	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
10306	a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
10307	What kids will discover is a new collectible .
10308	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .
10309	Stephen Earnhart 's homespun documentary Mule Skinner Blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens .
10310	... ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and Egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters ' crises with seriousness and compassion .
10311	The director , Steven Shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
10312	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
10313	The long-range appeal of `` Minority Report '' should transcend any awards it bags .
10314	Thoughtful , provocative and entertaining .
10315	An uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the Italian masterpiece .
10316	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
10317	When -LRB- De Palma 's -RRB- bad , he 's really bad , and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done .
10318	The film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience .
10319	Light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection .
10320	It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .
10321	The film delivers not just the full assault of Reno 's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .
10322	Energetic and boldly provocative .
10323	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
10324	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
10325	Vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
10326	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
10327	A dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
10328	What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
10329	For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
10330	... as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the Star Wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement .
10331	Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
10332	Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
10333	Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
10334	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
10335	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
10336	A modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
10337	If you can stomach the rough content , it 's worth checking out for the performances alone .
10338	The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
10339	It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
10340	With youthful high spirits , Tautou remains captivating throughout Michele 's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast .
10341	Gollum 's ` performance ' is incredible !
10342	Without ever becoming didactic , director Carlos Carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality .
10343	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .
10344	Do n't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ...
10345	just not campy enough
10346	It is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .
10347	It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
10348	It inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows . '
10349	I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
10350	Topkapi this is not .
10351	Farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to Willis 's world-weary colonel .
10352	Immediately .
10353	A triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness .
10354	As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
10355	Nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .
10356	How did it ever get made ?
10357	Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
10358	In Fessenden 's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale .
10359	Candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work .
10360	There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
10361	No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
10362	Nothing is black and white .
10363	Scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism .
10364	As the two leads , Lathan and Diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers .
10365	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
10366	Some actors have so much charisma that you 'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book .
10367	A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
10368	Throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , Nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another .
10369	Recalls quiet freak-outs like L'Avventura and Repulsion .
10370	Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
10371	Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .
10372	A mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser .
10373	De Oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by Michel Piccoli .
10374	Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .
10375	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
10376	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
10377	Almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent .
10378	Bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era 's creme de la celluloid .
10379	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
10380	It 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss .
10381	The recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom .
10382	Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
10383	So unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` Safe ! '
10384	One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .
10385	The weakest of the four Harry Potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins .
10386	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
10387	One from the heart .
10388	Ice Cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance ...
10389	Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .
10390	Look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .
10391	A byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido .
10392	A lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love .
10393	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
10394	Both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent I Spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .
10395	A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
10396	Admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .
10397	The ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece .
10398	And I 've decided to leave a light on every night from now on .
10399	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
10400	At its best , The Good Girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery ...
10401	Unfortunately , they 're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of Kahlo 's life imaginable .
10402	I do n't have an I Am Sam clue .
10403	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
10404	It 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .
10405	The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
10406	Go see it and enjoy .
10407	what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we 've shared a great adventure .
10408	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
10409	it 's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash
10410	Beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama .
10411	A worthwhile way to spend two hours .
10412	Try as I may , I ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '
10413	Director Nalin Pan does n't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other .
10414	Somewhat blurred , but Kinnear 's performance is razor sharp .
10415	The movie addresses a hungry need for PG-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it does n't go too much further .
10416	While it would be easy to give Crush the new title of Two Weddings and a Funeral , it 's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of Hugh Grant whimsy .
10417	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
10418	The Lion King was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on Imax it seems better , not just bigger .
10419	This bold and lyrical first feature from Raja Amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .
10420	Eight Crazy Nights is a showcase for Sandler 's many talents .
10421	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
10422	This version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful .
10423	Despite its title , Punch-Drunk Love is never heavy-handed .
10424	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .
10425	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
10426	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
10427	This Nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an Eddie Murphy film .
10428	Tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
10429	The movie gets muted and routine .
10430	It 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
10431	For anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of Hell Houses in particular , it 's an eye-opener .
10432	Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
10433	I hate this movie
10434	Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
10435	It 's still worth a look .
10436	The heightened symmetry of this new\/old Cinema Paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time .
10437	Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
10438	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
10439	But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
10440	A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
10441	The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
10442	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
10443	no currency
10444	The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
10445	Writer-director Burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear .
10446	It extends the writings of Jean Genet and John Rechy , the films of Fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of Goya .
10447	Director Clare Kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
10448	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
10449	A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .
10450	While not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there 's much truth and no small amount of poetry in Girls Ca n't Swim .
10451	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .
10452	Unfortunately , it appears that -LRB- Jackie -RRB- Chan 's US influence is starting to show in his Hong Kong films .
10453	... one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers I 've seen in quite a long time .
10454	It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .
10455	Do not see this film .
10456	There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
10457	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
10458	Newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , Mark Wahlberg .
10459	In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .
10460	The film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .
10461	... breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . '
10462	It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
10463	He just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality .
10464	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
10465	These are lives worth watching , paths worth following .
10466	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
10467	Is it something any true film addict will want to check out ?
10468	There 's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache .
10469	A well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship .
10470	Sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both Caine and Fraser have their moments .
10471	... -LRB- a -RRB- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
10472	But taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , The Queen of the Damned can not be said to suck .
10473	Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/
10474	Celebrated at Sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that 's hard to beat .
10475	A blessed gift to film geeks and historians .
10476	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
10477	The perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .
10478	Sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .
10479	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
10480	The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
10481	Nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ...
10482	A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
10483	MacDowell , whose wifty Southern charm has anchored lighter affairs ... brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role .
10484	Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
10485	Anthony Hopkins ?
10486	It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
10487	City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
10488	A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
10489	One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
10490	A breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters .
10491	When it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
10492	Everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids .
10493	In Adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns .
10494	A sour , nasty offering .
10495	A thinly veiled look at different aspects of Chinese life clashing with each other .
10496	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
10497	It may seem long at 110 minutes if you 're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .
10498	It is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come .
10499	Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
10500	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
10501	It proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study .
10502	Most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .
10503	There 's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like Steven Spielberg to follow A.I. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority .
10504	Suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative .
10505	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
10506	Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
10507	It 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
10508	It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
10509	Feature debuter D.J. Caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter Tony Gayton 's narcotics noir to life .
10510	But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
10511	Parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde 's still-contemporary play .
10512	Not a film to rival To Live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .
10513	The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -LRB- featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer -RRB- brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .
10514	Two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama .
10515	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
10516	Cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .
10517	Branagh , in his most forceful non-Shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .
10518	-LRB- Lawrence bounces -RRB- all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place .
10519	A giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of Oscar-winners : Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
10520	Claude Miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications .
10521	Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
10522	Though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static .
10523	There 's not much more to this adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm .
10524	While obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .
10525	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
10526	Both deeply weird and charmingly dear .
10527	An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...
10528	genuine insight
10529	I did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
10530	Stephen Rea , Aidan Quinn , and Alan Bates play Desmond 's legal eagles , and when joined by Brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty Irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , ` tis .
10531	The intent is almost exactly the same -LRB- as The Full Monty -RRB- .
10532	The best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates .
10533	It 's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru .
10534	Who knows what exactly Godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you .
10535	A movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats .
10536	Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
10537	It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
10538	... a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations .
10539	I like Frank the Pug , though .
10540	Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
10541	It settles for being merely grim .
10542	What makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved .
10543	A compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material .
10544	An infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy .
10545	Star Wars is back in a major way .
10546	Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
10547	It helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well .
10548	The lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .
10549	Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it 's called Where 's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?
10550	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix .
10551	An often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
10552	Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but
10553	A warm , funny , engaging film .
10554	Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .
10555	Detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
10556	But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .
10557	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
10558	-LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
10559	A slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered .
10560	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
10561	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
10562	A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
10563	His warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos .
10564	Trademark American triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent French drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son .
10565	New Best Friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
10566	This is as respectful a film as Byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it 's necessary .
10567	If your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely ca n't miss it .
10568	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
10569	Arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
10570	What Time Is It There ?
10571	An amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction .
10572	Nothing Denis has made before , like Beau Travil and Nenette et Boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre .
10573	A vivid cinematic portrait .
10574	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
10575	Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
10576	Despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show ... represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there 's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it .
10577	Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .
10578	It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
10579	The film seems a dead weight .
10580	Extremely confusing .
10581	A gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching .
10582	This is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all .
10583	A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
10584	Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .
10585	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
10586	Enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd .
10587	A cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
10588	Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
10589	A fascinating and fun film .
10590	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
10591	It will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .
10592	At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
10593	It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
10594	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
10595	when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
10596	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
10597	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
10598	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
10599	A work of astonishing delicacy and force .
10600	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
10601	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
10602	It 's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and Gibson , stepping in for Bruce Willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .
10603	The values that have held the Enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
10604	An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions .
10605	This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
10606	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
10607	An intriguing and entertaining introduction to Johnson .
10608	About nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the American dream .
10609	The film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the Motown sound .
10610	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
10611	Tim Story 's not there yet - but ` Barbershop ' shows he 's on his way .
10612	This time out , -LRB- Sade -RRB- is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested .
10613	-LRB- Serry -RRB- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
10614	At heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .
10615	This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
10616	Godawful boring slug of a movie .
10617	What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
10618	Nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative Nine Queens is lots of fun .
10619	Demands too much of most viewers .
10620	Director Benoit Jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with Tosca , conveys the heaving passion of Puccini 's famous love-jealousy - murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation .
10621	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
10622	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
10623	Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
10624	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
10625	That is a compliment to Kuras and Miller .
10626	Between the drama of Cube ?
10627	Good actress .
10628	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
10629	Baran is n't the most transporting or gripping film from Iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it 's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations .
10630	A sensual performance from Abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
10631	This riveting World War II moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of American culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms .
10632	The movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
10633	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .
10634	As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .
10635	I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
10636	The story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing Sayles dialogue .
10637	A worthy entry into a very difficult genre .
10638	It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
10639	Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
10640	The movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .
10641	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
10642	It 's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone 's head
10643	If you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .
10644	It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
10645	It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
10646	The movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design .
10647	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
10648	has a plot full of twists upon knots ... and a nonstop parade of mock-Tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill .
10649	Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
10650	It 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer .
10651	An artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre .
10652	An irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale .
10653	Those who would follow Haneke on his creepy explorations ... are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from Huppert and Magimel .
10654	Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
10655	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
10656	Hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in Burdette 's dialogue .
10657	But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
10658	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
10659	My goodness , Queen Latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts .
10660	But it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
10661	Must be seen to be believed .
10662	... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
10663	A soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
10664	Ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much .
10665	A feel-good picture in the best sense of the term .
10666	This illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the Holy Land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath .
10667	`` Roger Michell -LRB- '' Notting Hill `` -RRB- directs a morality thriller . ''
10668	This is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , Scorsese 's best in more than a decade .
10669	When it really counts ... Bloody Sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language .
10670	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
10671	Martin and Barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by Sven Wollter and Viveka Seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid .
10672	Happily for Mr. Chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match .
10673	Equilibrium is what George Orwell might have imagined had today 's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 .
10674	There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
10675	But if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked .
10676	Offers that rare combination of entertainment and education .
10677	Novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .
10678	But this time there 's some mold on the gold .
10679	The animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense .
10680	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
10681	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
10682	This is n't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .
10683	If you 're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then Mostly Martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .
10684	As a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions .
10685	Afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , All the Queen 's Men is finally just one long drag .
10686	Narc may not get an ` A ' for originality , but it wears its B-movie heritage like a badge of honor .
10687	More concerned with Sade 's ideas than with his actions .
10688	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
10689	Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
10690	I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .
10691	Bubba Ho-Tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by Bruce Campbell that does n't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .
10692	A quiet treasure -- a film to be savored .
10693	On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
10694	Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
10695	well worth the time .
10696	While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
10697	I loved it !
10698	Without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a Kieslowski morality tale
10699	A very bad sign .
10700	The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
10701	Even if you ca n't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly , you 'll appreciate much of Vardalos ' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries .
10702	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
10703	It 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .
10704	The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
10705	A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .
10706	The jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center .
10707	Is it a total success ?
10708	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
10709	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
10710	It will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth .
10711	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
10712	... too dull to enjoy .
10713	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
10714	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
10715	The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
10716	Moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not .
10717	Holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma .
10718	Ridiculous .
10719	This is n't my favorite in the series , still I enjoyed it enough to recommend .
10720	The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
10721	When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
10722	Feel bad for King , who 's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot .
10723	It is nature against progress .
10724	Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .
10725	Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .
10726	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .
10727	For the most part , director Anne-Sophie Birot 's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama .
10728	All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
10729	It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
10730	The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
10731	Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
10732	This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
10733	As surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming .
10734	Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
10735	On the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz 's and Kieslowski 's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique .
10736	Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
10737	Alex Nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget NC-17 version of Tank Girl .
10738	The seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going .
10739	A stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in Australia 's film history .
10740	A spellbinding African film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe .
10741	It 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , AND satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but Minority Report delivers all that and a whole lot more .
10742	A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending .
10743	Here 's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep .
10744	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .
10745	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
10746	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
10747	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .
10748	Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
10749	For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
10750	Morton is , as usual , brilliant .
10751	Excellent acting and direction .
10752	Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
10753	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
10754	Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
10755	A yarn that respects the Marvel version without becoming ensnared by it .
10756	Even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from Hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting .
10757	If it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .
10758	Highlights are the terrific performances by Christopher Plummer , as the prime villain , and Nathan Lane as Vincent Crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .
10759	Rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
10760	Awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another ` spectacular spectacle . '
10761	The subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
10762	It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
10763	` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
10764	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
10765	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
10766	There 's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances .
10767	Though it is by no means his best work , Laissez-Passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .
10768	Evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .
10769	... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
10770	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
10771	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
10772	Remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` Ecks vs. Sever '' or `` xXx '' was going to be ?
10773	Thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun .
10774	No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .
10775	Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
10776	Watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay 's sappier elements ... and sustains Off the Hook 's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer .
10777	You 've already seen Heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .
10778	The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
10779	The stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for Euro-film pretension .
10780	The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
10781	The French are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the Americans , who have a passion for Musketeers , only to spoof them .
10782	A good piece of work more often than not .
10783	A charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest Dogme film and among the most enjoyable .
10784	The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .
10785	Elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it 's therapeutic to laugh along with them .
10786	The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
10787	Long Time Dead ?
10788	The old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie 's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco Bollywood that , by the end of Monsoon Wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater .
10789	By taking Entertainment Tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , Auto Focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing .
10790	Boisterous and daft documentary .
10791	A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to .
10792	Just a bloody mess .
10793	Ford deserves to be remembered at Oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier .
10794	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
10795	A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .
10796	The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
10797	This horror-comedy does n't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count Elvira 's hooters .
10798	You 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .
10799	As shaky as the plot is , Kaufman 's script is still memorable for some great one-liners .
10800	This ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
10801	The emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma .
10802	The fact that The Rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .
10803	Not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream American audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit .
10804	It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
10805	A captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners .
10806	The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
10807	A pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place .
10808	Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .
10809	The film 's real appeal wo n't be to Clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .
10810	The New Guy does have a heart .
10811	Barely gets off the ground .
10812	At once half-baked and overheated .
10813	Just what makes us happy , anyway ?
10814	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
10815	An ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it .
10816	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
10817	A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
10818	An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
10819	Writer\/director Mark Romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in America .
10820	Solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts .
10821	essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of Aliens .
10822	A gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of Burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills .
10823	Enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age .
10824	I enjoyed Time of Favor while I was watching it , but I was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory .
10825	The mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted .
10826	Good ol' urban legend stuff .
10827	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
10828	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
10829	One of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling Blair Witch or The Others .
10830	I like the new footage and still love the old stuff .
10831	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
10832	... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
10833	Inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
10834	Now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism .
10835	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
10836	It 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker 's movie adaptation .
10837	One of -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- least inspired works .
10838	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
10839	Merely as a technical , logistical feat , Russian Ark marks a cinematic milestone .
10840	The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
10841	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
10842	A solidly seaworthy chiller .
10843	If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
10844	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
10845	Some of Seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
10846	Full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience .
10847	A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
10848	Haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .
10849	The laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while Russell and Dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them .
10850	Whether Kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion .
10851	A real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us do n't know .
10852	` De Niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this Hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
10853	Cho 's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience .
10854	Is office work really as alienating as ` Bartleby ' so effectively makes it ?
10855	A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
10856	The kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you .
10857	There are times when A Rumor of Angels plays like an extended episode of Touched by an Angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but I liked its heart and its spirit .
10858	Like Dickens with his passages , McGrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel .
10859	Though it 's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to Leigh for actually casting people who look working-class .
10860	Nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives Hollywood .
10861	Harsh , effective documentary on life in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories .
10862	A marvel like none you 've seen .
10863	If you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` The Isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .
10864	The terrific and bewilderingly underrated Campbell Scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing .
10865	A stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for Kissinger as a calculating war criminal .
10866	In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
10867	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
10868	Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .
10869	This is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults .
10870	The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
10871	The movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music .
10872	Lovely and poignant .
10873	Smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
10874	Dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments .
10875	A workshop mentality prevails .
10876	When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
10877	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
10878	Lauren Ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
10879	But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
10880	Resourceful and ingenious entertainment .
10881	When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .
10882	-LRB- Anderson -RRB- uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense .
10883	If you 're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here .
10884	... a story we have n't seen on the big screen before , and it 's a story that we as Americans , and human beings , should know .
10885	Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .
10886	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
10887	An incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar -LRB- and peculiarly venomous -RRB- bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
10888	Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
10889	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
10890	You 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
10891	It 's a sly wink to The Others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic .
10892	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America 's Sweetheart .
10893	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
10894	Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
10895	It 's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable American remake .
10896	The voices are fine as well .
10897	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
10898	It is amusing , and that 's all it needs to be .
10899	I complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but The Bourne Identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .
10900	Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .
10901	-LRB- It 's -RRB- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
10902	Marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .
10903	Although Jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for The Return of the King , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of The Two Towers .
10904	The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
10905	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
10906	Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
10907	Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
10908	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
10909	Hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people .
10910	Most new movies have a bright sheen .
10911	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
10912	Makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the Kurdish refugees of Iran 's borderlands .
10913	The film 's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone .
10914	An overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .
10915	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
10916	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
10917	No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
10918	But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
10919	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
10920	All Ms. Jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
10921	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
10922	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .
10923	Roman Coppola may never become the filmmaker his Dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will .
10924	A well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality .
10925	It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
10926	That 's pure PR hype .
10927	Now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .
10928	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
10929	As a witness to several Greek-American weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- I can testify to the comparative accuracy of Ms. Vardalos ' memories and insights .
10930	A cop story that understands the medium amazingly well .
10931	He can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he 'll get the girl .
10932	Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
10933	I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
10934	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to Barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
10935	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
10936	Hands down the year 's most thought-provoking film .
10937	Foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling .
10938	Ah yes , and then there 's the music ...
10939	It could change America , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
10940	What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .
10941	While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
10942	-LRB- A -RRB- superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of Graham Greene 's 1955 novel .
10943	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
10944	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
10945	A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
10946	It seems like I have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now I ca n't wait for the sequel .
10947	This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams .
10948	Having never been a huge fan of Dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure I had watching McGrath 's version .
10949	Remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster ... done up by Howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand .
10950	Between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
10951	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
10952	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
10953	A swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith .
10954	An elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller .
10955	Exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes .
10956	Intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed .
10957	Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
10958	For Caine Lovers only .
10959	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
10960	Bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he ca n't help throwing in a few of his own touches .
10961	It 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .
10962	The story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
10963	should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .
10964	The cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .
10965	Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .
10966	Although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .
10967	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
10968	Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
10969	-LRB- Newton -RRB- wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
10970	Makes S&M seem very romantic , and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight .
10971	-LRB- But it 's -RRB- worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser .
10972	When the first few villians are introduced as `` Spider '' and `` Snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak .
10973	Now , if it only had a brain .
10974	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
10975	Engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying .
10976	A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
10977	-LRB- Two -RRB- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
10978	It 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director 's previous Full Frontal .
10979	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
10980	In a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in .
10981	McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
10982	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
10983	You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
10984	The additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story .
10985	This clever caper movie has twists worthy of David Mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .
10986	No screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of Clones ' last 45 minutes .
10987	The movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as ... -LRB- Quills -RRB- did by showing them .
10988	This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
10989	There has always been something likable about the Marquis de Sade .
10990	Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
10991	Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
10992	The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
10993	I 'm just too bored to care .
10994	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
10995	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
10996	A provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love .
10997	Like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .
10998	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
10999	Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .
11000	Awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .
11001	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
11002	This is pretty dicey material .
11003	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
11004	The film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .
11005	Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .
11006	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
11007	It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
11008	Byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama .
11009	There is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .
11010	Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .
11011	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
11012	A smart , witty follow-up .
11013	To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
11014	We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict .
11015	A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
11016	The film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
11017	The appearance of Treebeard and Gollum 's expanded role will either have you loving what you 're seeing , or rolling your eyes .
11018	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
11019	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
11020	It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
11021	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
11022	What parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .
11023	Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
11024	Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
11025	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
11026	There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
11027	Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .
11028	It ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of Latin America 's most oppressive regimes .
11029	This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
11030	It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
11031	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .
11032	Like most Bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike .
11033	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
11034	Fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .
11035	It 's a buggy drag .
11036	Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
11037	It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
11038	A recent favourite at Sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of Def Leppard 's Pyromania .
11039	For movie lovers as well as opera lovers , Tosca is a real treat .
11040	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
11041	I have n't seen one in so long , no wonder I did n't recognize it at first .
11042	This concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned .
11043	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
11044	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
11045	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
11046	I admired this work a lot .
11047	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
11048	This is really just another genre picture .
11049	Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
11050	Immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop DJs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch .
11051	Vera 's three actors
11052	You see Robert De Niro singing - and dancing to - West Side Story show tunes .
11053	Anyway , for one reason or another , Crush turns into a dire drama partway through .
11054	... the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes `` What Time Is It There ? ''
11055	Francophiles will snicker knowingly and you 'll want to slap them .
11056	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
11057	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
11058	Stay clear of reminding yourself that it 's a `` true story '' and you 're likely to have one helluva time at the movies .
11059	A miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
11060	When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
11061	A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .
11062	It has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .
11063	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
11064	An experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .
11065	I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
11066	An eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
11067	If you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , Wasabi is a good place to start .
11068	There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
11069	The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
11070	-LRB- Majidi -RRB- makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day .
11071	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
11072	All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
11073	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
11074	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
11075	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
11076	Claude Chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that 's okay .
11077	Romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score .
11078	Digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world .
11079	If this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you ca n't wait to see what happens next .
11080	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
11081	Benefits from a strong performance from Zhao , but it 's Dong Jie 's face you remember at the end .
11082	Worth watching for Dong Jie 's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .
11083	A bit of an unwieldy mess .
11084	But based on CQ , I 'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project .
11085	There are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness .
11086	The film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today 's cinema du sarcasm
11087	The story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that 's rare in film today , but be warned : It 's a slow slog to get there .
11088	a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the Bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives .
11089	Why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson , Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED ?
11090	Morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but Morvern Callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start .
11091	There are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .
11092	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
11093	I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
11094	It 's also the year 's sweetest movie .
11095	Bourne , Jason Bourne .
11096	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
11097	Not for the prurient or squeamish , it 's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics .
11098	... mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern Beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return .
11099	A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience .
11100	A subtle and well-crafted -LRB- for the most part -RRB- chiller .
11101	A slick , skillful little horror film .
11102	Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
11103	A sly game of cat and mouse that 's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances .
11104	It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
11105	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
11106	But you 'll definitely want the T-shirt .
11107	The disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on .
11108	Fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away .
11109	` Abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let Dante 's gloomy words be your guide .
11110	A tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled African-American 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .
11111	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
11112	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
11113	Ramsay , as in Ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid .
11114	From the big giant titles of the opening credits to Elmer Bernstein 's perfectly melodic score , Haynes gets just about everything right .
11115	It risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise .
11116	Binoche and Magimel are perfect in these roles .
11117	If you dig on David Mamet 's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy !
11118	Steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it 's so clever you want to hate it .
11119	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
11120	Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
11121	A coarse and stupid gross-out .
11122	The movie is one of the best examples of artful Large Format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon .
11123	It 's slow -- very , very slow .
11124	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
11125	What would Jesus do if He was a film director ?
11126	Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
11127	It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
11128	A potent allegorical love story .
11129	Anyone who can count to five -LRB- the film 's target market ? -RRB-
11130	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
11131	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
11132	Haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you 're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed .
11133	Ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year 's best acting , Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
11134	Attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .
11135	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
11136	By presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , Pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what 's possible and what we might do to make it so .
11137	In the end , Ted Bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
11138	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
11139	This tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , Nicholas Meyer 's Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country .
11140	Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
11141	I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .
11142	Everything that has to do with Yvan and Charlotte , and everything that has to do with Yvan 's rambunctious , Jewish sister and her non-Jew husband , feels funny and true .
11143	Children may not understand everything that happens -- I 'm not sure even Miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted .
11144	A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .
11145	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
11146	If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .
11147	A gimmick in search of a movie : how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
11148	This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
11149	Or some damn thing .
11150	In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
11151	Some studio pizazz might have helped .
11152	Occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for Zhao .
11153	Binoche makes it interesting trying to find out .
11154	An endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .
11155	Fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way ... that feels very human and very true to life .
11156	Not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care .
11157	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
11158	This is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming .
11159	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
11160	Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
11161	Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects .
11162	U.S. audiences may find -LRB- Attal and Gainsbourg 's -RRB- unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what Hollywood typically concocts .
11163	Murderous Maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth .
11164	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
11165	The movie bounces all over the map .
11166	Escaping the studio , Piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie .
11167	It is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of Leon 's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction .
11168	Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately Serving Sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .
11169	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
11170	Hilarious , acidic Brit comedy .
11171	Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
11172	Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
11173	If we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
11174	Demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
11175	It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
11176	Is n't quite the equal of Woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest American film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his Hong Kong films .
11177	The editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
11178	Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
11179	Funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director George Hickenlooper all takes place in Pasadena , `` a city where people still read . ''
11180	Alas , it 's neither .
11181	Ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie 's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible .
11182	You wo n't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who 's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all .
11183	A masterpiece four years in the making .
11184	One minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
11185	But what spectacular sizzle it is !
11186	Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .
11187	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
11188	The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
11189	While Undercover Brother is definitely one for the masses , it 's also full of sharp , smart satire .
11190	Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
11191	Finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .
11192	As a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , Standing in the Shadows of Motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .
11193	Blanchett 's performance confirms her power once again .
11194	The filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .
11195	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
11196	A gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life .
11197	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
11198	Finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original .
11199	Illuminating if overly talky documentary .
11200	Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
11201	Dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver .
11202	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .
11203	What Full Frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment .
11204	It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .

11227	The end result is a film that 's neither .
11228	The quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy .

11255	A pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances .
11256	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .

11306	Both awful and appealing .
11307	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
11308	This romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime England , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s .
11309	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .

11312	While this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying .
11313	No way I can believe this load of junk .
11314	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
11315	do you
11316	Theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical .
11317	If you 're in the mood for a Bollywood film , here 's one for you .
11318	It 's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant .
11319	It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
11320	Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
11321	All-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .
11322	Some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast .
11323	Parker holds true to Wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
11324	Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
11325	We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !
11326	It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
11327	It dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile .
11328	Escapism in its purest form .
11329	The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
11330	A richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind .
11331	Ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
11332	No more .
11333	For anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man 's response to stroke , Ram Dass : Fierce Grace is worth seeking out .
11334	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
11335	The movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that 's all too rare in Hollywood 's hastier productions .
11336	So refreshingly incisive is Grant that for the first time he 'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the Hugh factor .
11337	Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
11338	The movie is n't just hilarious : It 's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb .
11339	The ending is a cop-out .
11340	-LRB- It 's -RRB- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
11341	Even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the American Insomnia is still pretty darned good .
11342	The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear .
11343	What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
11344	It tells more than it shows .
11345	A journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking .
11346	An excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind .
11347	Fans of Behan 's work and of Irish movies in general will be rewarded by Borstal Boy .
11348	A picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion .
11349	Reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .
11350	It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .
11351	Everything that 's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
11352	Undercover Brother does n't go far enough .
11353	Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
11354	Occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going .
11355	Slick piece of cross-promotion .
11356	A pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors .
11357	As the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing .
11358	More maudlin than sharp .
11359	In spite of Good Housekeeping 's unsavory characters and WWF mentality , this white trash War of the Roses is a surprisingly engaging film .
11360	Thurman and Lewis are hilarious throughout .
11361	Little more than a frothy vanity project .
11362	Impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .
11363	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
11364	Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
11365	No wonder they 're talking about `` Talk to Her . ''
11366	The film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it 's an enjoyable one .
11367	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
11368	-LRB- E -RRB- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .
11369	My oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
11370	The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
11371	Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .
11372	Too simple for its own good .
11373	The result is something quite fresh and delightful .
11374	My thoughts were focused on the characters .
11375	It 's a Count for our times .
11376	A pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable .
11377	It 's -LRB- Ricci 's -RRB- best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world 's misery with blind good will .
11378	An ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
11379	Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
11380	There 's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable .
11381	This is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story 's a little weak .
11382	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
11383	Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
11384	Hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile -LRB- emphasized here -RRB- accent the humor of Wilson 's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness .
11385	Jaglom ... put -LRB- s -RRB- the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
11386	The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
11387	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
11388	As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
11389	If the ' 70 's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy .
11390	Not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics .
11391	The film 's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard ...
11392	another great ` what you do n't see ' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
11393	Neither Parker nor Donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
11394	Led by Griffin 's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material .
11395	You bet .
11396	It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
11397	A movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the Godzilla sized soda .
11398	The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
11399	A loving little film of considerable appeal .
11400	Unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such ` Have-yourself-a-happy-little-Holocaust ' movies as Life Is Beautiful and Jakob the Liar , The Grey Zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in Auschwitz .
11401	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you 've imagined The Ring .
11402	What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
11403	Here 's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
11404	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
11405	does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
11406	There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
11407	... is an arthritic attempt at directing by Callie Khouri .
11408	The fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural French school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work .
11409	A sometimes tedious film .
11410	Offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends .
11411	A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .
11412	A heavy reliance on CGI technology is beginning to creep into the series .
11413	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .
11414	Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
11415	It 's a demented kitsch mess -LRB- although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative -RRB- , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .
11416	Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
11417	One of the more intelligent children 's movies to hit theaters this year .
11418	Or a profit .
11419	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
11420	It 's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ...
11421	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
11422	A spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages .
11423	Worth the effort to watch .
11424	Sandra Nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed Martha as her heart begins to open .
11425	Huppert gives Erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she 'll crack .
11426	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
11427	The film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
11428	Using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , Dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead .
11429	Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
11430	equal amounts
11431	Has a lot of the virtues of Eastwood at his best .
11432	All I can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
11433	Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
11434	I 've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
11435	It 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .
11436	Chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement .
11437	While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
11438	Gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film .
11439	A simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them .
11440	A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
11441	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
11442	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
11443	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
11444	Smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .
11445	It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
11446	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
11447	Beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... -LRB- but -RRB- the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
11448	Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .
11449	Insomnia is involving .
11450	Disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... Tuck Everlasting is a little of both .
11451	What 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an Ikea world .
11452	And that 's a big part of why we go to the movies .
11453	Should have been someone else -
11454	It represents better-than-average movie-making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience .
11455	Altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece .
11456	Writer\/director John McKay ignites some charming chemistry between Kate and Jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and Kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
11457	If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
11458	Provide -LRB- s -RRB- nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue .
11459	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
11460	Part low rent Godfather .
11461	Do n't waste your money .
11462	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
11463	By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good .
11464	Hey , who else needs a shower ?
11465	Lan Yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most American love stories look downright unfree .
11466	A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan .
11467	Bennett 's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any ` reality ' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch Some Body first .
11468	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
11469	I hated every minute of it .
11470	Not since Tom Cruise in Risky Business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear .
11471	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
11472	A comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience .
11473	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
11474	You 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
11475	A broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
11476	Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
11477	It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
11478	So many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but Family Fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .
11479	With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual Broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
11480	A savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in America 's culture of fear .

11485	So young , so smart , such talent , such a wise \*\*\* .
11486	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
11487	It 's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that does n't feel it has to prove anything .
11488	You 're better off staying home and watching The X-Files .
11489	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
11490	As if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , Kathryn Bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness .
11491	Kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble .
11492	comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .
11493	Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi 's generic angst -LRB- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -RRB- .
11494	-LRB- Leigh -RRB- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
11495	Like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it 's significant without being overstated .
11496	It does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .
11497	It 's fun lite .
11498	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
11499	Director Kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier English-language movie , the overpraised Elizabeth .
11500	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
11501	An involving true story of a Chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution -- acted mostly by the actual people involved .
11502	When not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray 's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean .
11503	`` The Emperor 's New Clothes '' begins with a simple plan ... Well , at least that 's the plan .
11504	very solid , very watchable first feature for director Peter Sheridan
11505	Although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do .
11506	The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
11507	It took 19 predecessors to get THIS ?
11508	However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
11509	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
11510	Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .
11511	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .
11512	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
11513	An exquisitely crafted and acted tale .
11514	So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
11515	She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
11516	Without a strong script and energetic acting , Dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos .
11517	It 's as close as we 'll ever come to looking through a photographer 's viewfinder as he works .
11518	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
11519	Tim Allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .
11520	The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
11521	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
11522	Good film , but very glum .
11523	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
11524	This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
11525	The tenderness of the piece is still intact .
11526	Kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night Matthew was killed .
11527	But some unexpected zigs and zags help .
11528	I love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off .
11529	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
11530	Good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of European , American and Asian influences .
11531	As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
11532	What the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as Corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action .
11533	It is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish .
11534	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
11535	A deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish .
11536	It 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
11537	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
11538	`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
11539	Run , do n't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .
11540	This is n't a narrative film -- I do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about September 11th , though I 'm sure some will try -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come .
11541	But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-
11542	This is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of Iranian rural life close to the Iraqi border .

11544	Skip work to see it at the first opportunity .
11545	Effective but too-tepid biopic
11546	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
11547	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
11548	` Charly ' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy ...
11549	There is a refreshing absence of cynicism in Stuart Little 2 -- quite a rarity , even in the family film market .
11550	As a first-time director , Paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides Frailty with its dark soul .
11551	The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
11552	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
11553	Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry , but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling 's books .
11554	Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .
11555	... Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .
11556	The film is exhilarating to watch because Sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
11557	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
11558	The film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the Catholic doctrine
11559	` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .
11560	George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
11561	... has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they 're ghosts imagining themselves as alive .
11562	Charles ' entertaining film chronicles Seinfeld 's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic Adams ' attempts to get his shot at the big time .
11563	Which is n't to say that it 's the equal of some of its predecessors .
11564	A compelling Spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession .
11565	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
11566	The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative -LRB- and sometimes illegal -RRB- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .
11567	Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I 'd hoped the movie would avoid .
11568	` How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
11569	This is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
11570	It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
11571	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
11572	A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
11573	Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
11574	Quite funny for the type of movie it is ...
11575	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
11576	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
11577	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
11578	It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
11579	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .
11580	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
11581	A reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .
11582	An intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you 're getting its metaphysical point .
11583	-LRB- Howard -RRB- so good as Leon Barlow ... that he hardly seems to be acting .
11584	Viewers of `` The Ring '' are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes .
11585	Subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , The Piano Teacher is a daring work of genius .
11586	We root for -LRB- Clara and Paul -RRB- , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity .
11587	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
11588	It is also , at times , curiously moving .
11589	I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
11590	The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
11591	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
11592	It 's rather like a Lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable .
11593	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
11594	Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
11595	... if you 're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games .
11596	While McFarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story .
11597	In a word -- yes .
11598	The next generation of mob movie .
11599	The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .
11600	Good movie .
11601	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
11602	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
11603	If the first Men in Black was money , the second is small change .
11604	Like Mike is n't interested in recycling old cliches .
11605	Its maker , Steven Spielberg , has n't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping Indiana Jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .
11606	An important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values .
11607	Fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment .
11608	Andersson creates a world that 's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad .
11609	An earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
11610	Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .
11611	If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan .
11612	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
11613	Exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven ... -LRB- the film -RRB- addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce .
11614	Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
11615	Big Fat Waste of Time .
11616	Has it ever been possible to say that Williams has truly inhabited a character ?
11617	Meandering , sub-aquatic mess : It 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .
11618	Audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film 's tart , sugar-free wit .
11619	Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LRB- the movie 's -RRB- mindset .
11620	The story ... is moldy and obvious .
11621	More a load of enjoyable , Conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the Mummy pictures represent .
11622	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
11623	As expected , Sayles ' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances .
11624	It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
11625	A frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women .
11626	It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
11627	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
11628	A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
11629	I just loved every minute of this film .
11630	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
11631	There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
11632	The lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .
11633	This is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
11634	William Shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ...
11635	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
11636	May be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .
11637	The production values are up there .
11638	There 's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that 's what makes it irresistible .
11639	A very well-made , funny and entertaining picture .
11640	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
11641	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
11642	A deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect .
11643	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
11644	It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
11645	Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
11646	It further declares its director , Zhang Yang of Shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .
11647	Achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium .
11648	For the most part , the ingredients are there .
11649	If it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then SL2 does just that .
11650	A celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals ' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences .
11651	Those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know .
11652	It 's laughing at us .
11653	Uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity .
11654	Doug Liman , the director of Bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie 's spycraft and uses Damon 's ability to be focused and sincere .
11655	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
11656	A romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
11657	Rare is the ` urban comedy ' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie .
11658	Moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a David and Goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out .
11659	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
11660	It might be tempting to regard Mr. Andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but Mr. Earnhart 's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .
11661	-LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
11662	The Son 's Room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos .
11663	Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .
11664	Will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
11665	Not nearly long enough .
11666	It 's hard not to be seduced by -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max .
11667	Its well of thorn and vinegar -LRB- and simple humanity -RRB- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
11668	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
11669	The movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects .
11670	Vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love .
11671	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
11672	Dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement .
11673	It 's a beautiful madness .
11674	A sports movie with action that 's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it .
11675	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
11676	... a well-observed and disturbing little movie
11677	It moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it does n't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the Cold War datedness -- of its premise .
11678	can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
11679	What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
11680	I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .
11681	The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
11682	A grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
11683	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
11684	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
11685	Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : Young is cool , and too young is too cool .
11686	Even in this less-than-magic kingdom , Reese rules .
11687	Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
11688	The film 's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip .
11689	It 's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .
11690	Those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find What Time Is It There ?
11691	While surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing .
11692	The visuals alone make Metropolis worth seeing .
11693	You 've seen them a million times .
11694	Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
11695	The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ...
11696	It 's one of the saddest films I have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
11697	It provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot .
11698	It 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .
11699	Like Mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for Lil Bow Wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well .
11700	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
11701	The film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable .
11702	Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
11703	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
11704	Egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
11705	In a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the Discovery Channel .
11706	Often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but Seldahl and Wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .
11707	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
11708	Here 's a British flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you .
11709	An impressive debut for first-time writer-director Mark Romanek , especially considering his background is in music video .
11710	An operatic , sprawling picture that 's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length .
11711	Under 15 ?
11712	Holden Caulfield did it better .
11713	Ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it .
11714	Jacquot 's Tosca is a treat .
11715	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
11716	It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
11717	No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
11718	A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
11719	It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
11720	A romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions .
11721	For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
11722	A charming , quirky and leisurely paced Scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from Monty Python 's Meaning of Life .
11723	If your senses have n't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you 're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket .
11724	Too much of the humor falls flat .
11725	A mild , reluctant , thumbs down .
11726	The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
11727	-LRB- Davis -RRB- has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
11728	Maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
11729	Shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .
11730	While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
11731	-LRB- An -RRB- hilarious romantic comedy .
11732	The inspirational screenplay by Mike Rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end .
11733	To the film 's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and Munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment .
11734	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
11735	The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket -LRB- second prize , of course , two free tickets -RRB- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .

11738	One of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it .
11739	Sure , it 's more of the same , but as the film proves , that 's not always a bad thing .
11740	With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams writer\/director\/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
11741	It 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .
11742	In his debut as a film director , Denzel Washington delivers a lean and engaging work .
11743	Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .
11744	Windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
11745	A worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant ` co-stars . '
11746	Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
11747	I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
11748	A bravura exercise in emptiness .
11749	Ecks this one off your must-see list .

11751	Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
11752	It 's also stupider .
11753	Fails to bring as much to the table .

11755	What you would end up with if you took Orwell , Bradbury , Kafka , George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender .
11756	The movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life .
11757	But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
11758	It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
11759	I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
11760	First good , then bothersome .
11761	`` Mostly Martha '' is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see .
11762	Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .
11763	The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
11764	For its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .
11765	It is now .
11766	Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .
11767	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
11768	Every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency .
11769	Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
11770	Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
11771	A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -LRB- Besson 's -RRB- earlier work .
11772	Barely goes beyond comic book status .
11773	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
11774	Chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : David Jacobson 's Dahmer .
11775	When your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily .
11776	As adapted by Kevin Molony from Simon Leys ' novel `` The Death of Napoleon '' and directed by Alan Taylor , Napoleon 's journey is interesting but his Parisian rebirth is stillborn
11777	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco 's last album ?
11778	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
11779	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
11780	A sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life .
11781	As Bundy , Michael Reilly Burke -LRB- Octopus 2 : River of Fear -RRB- has just the right amount of charisma and menace .
11782	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
11783	As teen movies go , `` Orange County '' is a refreshing change
11784	Purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that U.S. foreign policy has played in the rise of Castro .
11785	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
11786	A real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member .
11787	Though the film 's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare .
11788	Her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant .
11789	Hits one out of the park for the ` they do n't make 'em like that anymore ' department .
11790	Visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .
11791	Great story , bad idea for a movie .
11792	The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
11793	Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
11794	But it still jingles in the pocket .
11795	Chao was Chen Kaige 's assistant for years in China .
11796	I ca n't say that I liked Homeboy ; it 'd be more accurate to say that I found it intriguing , bizarre , Dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way .
11797	Zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast .
11798	A simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past .
11799	A tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty .
11800	When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
11801	It 's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown Chelsea Hotel ...
11802	If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
11803	Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence
11804	Just how extreme are these ops ?
11805	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
11806	... Mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . '
11807	Well , it does go on forever .
11808	Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
11809	Brimful .
11810	Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
11811	The subtle strength of `` Elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation .
11812	Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .
11813	A fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in Japanese animation .

11816	A solid examination of the male midlife crisis .
11817	After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
11818	But even a hero can stumble sometimes .
11819	Like its two predecessors , 1983 's Koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's Powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage Naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .
11820	... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
11821	A beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from Disney .
11822	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
11823	And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .
11824	There 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
11825	One of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you 're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you did n't know was being taken .
11826	Nothing about it fits .
11827	Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
11828	All the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
11829	Yeah , these flicks are just that damn good .
11830	But it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds .
11831	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
11832	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .

11834	Some actors steal scenes .
11835	Something like scrubbing the toilet .

11837	Davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces .
11838	The Hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound .
11839	From spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , Vincent 's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of Jean Renoir .
11840	We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
11841	Maud and Roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but LaBute pulls off a neater trick in Possession : He makes language sexy .
11842	So I just did .
11843	The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
11844	Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
11845	A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .
11846	Birthday Girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments .
11847	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
11848	Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
11849	Moretti 's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss .
11850	Montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .
11851	Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
11852	Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
11853	With tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , Miller 's film is one of 2002 's involvingly adult surprises .
11854	They should have called it Gutterball .
11855	A long-winded , predictable scenario .
